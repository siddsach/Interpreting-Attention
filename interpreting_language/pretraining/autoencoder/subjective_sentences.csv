"Caving in to the international pressure, the United States pretended to support the creation of an independent Palestinian state."
The prospect for the settlement of the Middle East issue is still bleak due to those who stand in the way of the settlement.
"However, this is no reason to be optimistic about the situation."
"On 17 November, Israeli troops pulled out of Tulkarm, a West Bank area of the Jordan River."
"In September last year Israeli Prime Minister Sharon, the then leader of the opposition party, visited a holy place in Kuds [Jerusalem], throwing Israel and Palestine into a fierce fight."
The clash between Israel and Palestine briefly appeared to be abating in the wake of the large-scale attack incident [taesupkyok sakon] against the United States.
"Today, in order to find a correct solution to the Middle East issue, it is important to frustrate Israel's territorial ambition and create conditions for Palestine to create an independent state of its own."
Israel's scheme is to make Palestine a vassal state and bring it under its control.
This is why Israel agreed to discuss the issue of granting independence to Palestine on conditions that Palestine claim only a small piece of territory and waive its right to raise [organize] a regular army.
International pressure is on Israel again.
It is an urgent matter for Israel to withdraw completely from the occupied land of Palestine.
"As such, Israel's territorial ambition is persistent and clever."
"On 18 November, the following day Israel began withdrawing its troops from Tulkarm, Israeli troops deliberately gunned down two Palestinians in the Palestinian autonomous areas as if they were quarries."
It was in fact due to strong international pressure that Israel began withdrawing its troops from the Palestinian autonomous area.
"As a result, the situation has become tense again."
"However, it has become fierce again after Israeli minister of tourism was assassinated."
"The United States, which is currently waging a war in Afghanistan, tried to shore up support from Arab states and Islamic world through a crafty ruse."
"Toward the end of October, Israel declared that it would withdraw from some of the Palestinian autonomous areas where the situation was ""relatively calm"" and pretended to be abiding by the decision."
It is also obvious that the aggressive US policy toward the Middle East will remain unchanged.
Israel makes itself appear to be withdrawing its troops from some of the occupied Palestinian autonomous areas.
The United Nations and many countries around the world began paying attention again to the situation in the Middle East that is becoming more complicated.
Sharon's remarks and behavior that were insulting to the Palestinians infuriated Palestine.
Israel has never abandoned its aggressive ambitions.
"However, it stopped withdrawing its troops halfway through under the pretext of ""unstable situation"" and occupied them again."
"Apart from this, we cannot talk about the settlement of the Middle East issue."
There is no way of knowing whether or not Israel will halt the withdrawal of its troops again under any pretext as it did before.
The US administration is about to call on Israel to support the creation of a Palestinian state with East Kuds as its capital.
"Convinced that the United States can never abandon it completely, Israel is dragging its feet on the withdrawal of troops citing a variety of excuses."
"The great leader [suryong] Comrade Kim Il-song taught: 
	
	
 ""Imperialism is the source of war and the disturber of peace."""
"Commenting on this, many Arab states and international opinion emphatically said that it is nothing more than a political stratagem to win support for its war in Afghanistan and to further expand the sphere of its domination in the Middle East."
Israel is adamantly against the creation of a completely independent Palestinian state.
"Taking advantage of this, Israel occupied six cities located in the Palestinian autonomous areas by the use of force."
"Seeing through the US scheme, Israel refused to continue the troop withdrawal from the Palestinian autonomous area."
It is quite obvious that Israel will employ a crafty trick in the future to realize its burning territorial ambition.
The desperate fight even took tolls of women and children.
"The United States, which has been in the van of invading other countries, is about to put pressure on Israel, not because it is now more sympathetic to Palestine or finds Palestine more tolerable than before, but because of its own national interests."
"On 20 November, the Israeli army bulldozed dwelling houses in the Palestinian autonomous area and even committed such an atrocious act as wounding Palestinians without hesitation."
"Yoshihiko Yamada, domestic division chief of Nippon Foundation's Department of Marine Affairs said, ""There were very few piracy attacks for ransom on commercial vessels."
"However, the foundation warned that the number of pirate attacks, in the new form of sea jacking ships for ransom, has been increasing."
"In April, in waters off Sumatra Island, an armed group ambushed a cruise ship."
"In addition, an Indonesian-registered ship was attacked and the crews from two ships, including a captain, were kidnapped and held for ransom."
"During the past several years, pirate attacks have shifted from a ""syndicated"" crime of attacking large cargo ships to a minor crime of theft or robbery."
"In June, six cases of pirate attacks took place in one day in waters near northern island of Borneo, in which trawl-boats and lumber carriers were ambushed."
The Nippon Foundation revealed that the number of pirates in Southeast Asia attacking ships for ransom is on rise.
"Involved were two employees, of a local company that had merged with an established Japanese oil-related company, and an Indonesian state-run company."
"However, negotiations about ransom were not disclosed."
The most prominent form of such attacks is sea jack for ransom.
"Among the eight attacks noted above, it was confirmed that a ransom payment was made in five of the cases."
"Ninety of the attacks, approximately half of attacks that took place in the world, were reported in Southeast Asian waters."
"A prevailing view is that these piracy attacks are actually committed by anti-government guerrillas amidst mounting political unrest."""
"According to the International Maritime Bureau, a civic organ which acts on reports of suspicious shipping movements, piracy, and armed robbery at sea anywhere in the world, the number of pirate attacks in the first half of this year stood 165, exceeding the record high of 161 pirate attacks in 2000."
"In particular, Japan and European countries are likely to persuade developing countries including South Korea to take part in the reduction of greenhouse gases earlier than planned in an attempt to secure the United States' ratification of the protocol."
"If the protocol, which prescribes an obligatory reduction of greenhouse gases, is put into effect, the nation's export will be heavily damaged."
"""The government should provide domestic firms real aid like tax reductions and environmental technology development rather than abstractly recommend domestic firms promote energy efficiency and lower energy consumption,"" an industry source said."
"Moreover, the pressures from advanced countries to get South Korea to cut its greenhouse gas emissions is expected to strengthen."
"Seoul, Nov. 19 (Yonhap) -- The recent settlement of details regarding the Kyoto Protocol is putting local exporters on alert."
"If things go on like this, the government must transform the current industrial structure into an environment-friendly one and minimize industries which use a host of energy such as petrochemicals and cement manufacturing."
"South Korea ranked ninth on a list of the largest greenhouse gas producers, and Korea's per-capita emissions were also close to those of advanced countries."
The Kyoto Protocol is an agreement to get 30 leading industrialized countries such as Japan and members of the European Union (EU) to lessen greenhouse gas emissions by amounts as high as 95 percent of levels in the 1990's.
"Unless measures that comply with the Kyoto Protocol are mapped out early, the nation's competitiveness in manufacturing sectors will weaken soon."
The reason is that South Korea's industrial structure depends heavily on the export of products including not only durable appliances such as air conditioner but also automobiles all of which should meet intensified environmental standards before they can be shipped overseas under the Protocol.
"The Kyoto Protocol was made by members of the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change at its seventh session held in Marrakech, Morocco at the start of the month."
"According to an April survey of 416 firms across the country conducted by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), 60 percent of total respondents said the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change will greatly influence local firms But only 28.4 percent replied that they are rushing to conform to the protocol's requirements."
"The U.S. backed out of the agreement, saying its industries would be handicapped by stringent rules that developing countries could simply ignore."
"Also, advanced nations are likely to make use of the standards as a new trade barrier."
The government will have to pour a lot of money into businesses to promote energy efficiency.
"Even though South Korea declared its intention to discuss its duty to cut down greenhouse gases from 2018, there is little possibility that advanced nations will wait until then."
"Under this situation, the nation cannot possibly avoid pressures to match the cuts of advanced nations."
"The government and business circle expect the nation's exports to be damaged in direct and indirect ways from 2008, when advanced nations will begin to be regulated by the protocol."
"These problems would have to be dealt with under international plans to rebuild Afghanistan, which is estimated may cost 10 billion dollars and may take, Grandi told Tanka, three to four years to achieve."
Japan has taken a leading role in the international drive to rebuild Afghanistan and in January is to host a meeting of finance and foreign ministers from more than 22 countries to build a platform for commitments to rebuild a country shattered by more than two decades of war.
"The talks focused on the need to rehabilitate Afghanistan to pave the way for the safe return of the estimated four million Afghan refugees living in neighbouring countries, foreign ministry spokesman Daisuke Matsunaga said."
"Since the terrorist strikes in the United States, more than 135,000 refugees have crossed into Pakistan, but the United Nations says the true figure is much higher."
"He told a news conference that Filippo Grandi, regional emergency coordinator for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), had thanked Japan for its contribution to international efforts to aid the refugees."
"He added that Grandi had outlined to Tanka a four-pronged approach to the crisis -- improving conditions in camps, expanding the UNHCR's ability to deal with any further refugees, assisting non-governmental organisations involved in dealing with the crisis, and encouraging refugees to return to their homes."
"It has offered financial support to Pakistan, including the rescheduling of around 550 million dollars in debt and the provision of about 40 million dollars in emergency budgetary and refugee assistance."
"""The talks were very warm,"" Matsunaga said at the end of the meeting."
"Even before September 11, Pakistan was playing host to an estimated 2.5 million refugees who had fled Afghanistan through 22 years of war and ethnic bloodshed."
"ISLAMABAD, Nov 24 (AFP) - Japanese Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka held ""warm"" talks here on Saturday with a senior UN official on the refugee crisis in Afghanistan and the hazards facing those wanting to return, a Japanese official said."
"Returning refugees, however, faced minefields, a lack of educational facilities and ruined irrigation systems."
"Tanka, who arrived in Pakistan on Friday for talks on the reconstruction of Afghanistan and to reward Islamabad for its role in the war against terrorism, was due to meet Pakistani counterpart Abdul Sattar later Saturday and President Pervez Musharraf on Monday."
"In the meantime, however, the UNHCR, through its Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (OCHA), was trying to provide tents, clothing and heaters to returning refugees as well as to displaced people within the country wanting to return to their towns and villages."
"""Definitely,"" he said."
Misuari launched his revolt after Arroyo decided to back an MNLF rival in an election to be held Monday to choose the next ARMM governor.
"""The Philippine government has information that Mr. Misuari has of late developed some links with the Abu Sayyaf about whom more need not be said,"" he said."
"The boat was being checked for weapons, said the source, who would not be identified."
Lecaros said that Misuari had developed ties with the Abu Sayyaf rebel group that has carried out a spree of kidnappings.
"Lecaros, from the foreign ministry, said the arrest was a sign that the ASEAN, ""particularly Malaysia, is succeeding in the effort against terrorism."""
The government has deployed thousands of troops to Jolo to deter attempts by Misuari followers to disrupt the balloting.
The neighbors lack an extradition treaty.
"ASEAN includes Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam."
"""Misuari is not just any lawbreaking person,"" Lecaros said."
"Malaysia, which had given sanctuary to Misuari and his guerrillas in the early 1970s, has called on Misuari to end a bloody six-day-old rebellion by his followers in the southern Philippine island of Jolo."
"MANILA, Nov 24 (AFP) - President Gloria Arroyo praised Malaysia on Saturday for the swift arrest of Muslim leader Nur Misuari, whose forces embarked on a fresh rebellion this week in the southern Philippines."
Bernama quoted Malaysian police chief Norian Mai as saying police would try to hand Misuari and his men over to the Philippine government as soon as possible.
The group pledged to counter terrorism at a summit in Brunei this month as well as a summit with their main trading partners in Shanghai in October.
Manila wants to put Misuari on trial for rebellion in connection with a revolt on Monday which claimed at least 113 lives.
A source at the Malaysian embassy in Manila said the Royal Malaysian Police intercepted Misuari's speedboat and arrested all its occupants.
"He suggested that Kuala Lumpur would have to take the initiative, saying that Misuari had apparently violated Malaysian law by entering the country without a passport."
"""We have to enforce the law."""
"Arroyo was ""very satisfied that the Malaysian government has been efficient enough to arrest him,"" her spokesman Rigoberto Tiglao told DZBB radio here."
The Philippine foreign ministry this week cancelled Misuari's regular and diplomatic passports as a Jolo court ordered his arrest.
"Foreign department spokesman Victoriano Lecaros said the arrest should serve as ""a warning to terrorists that they will find themselves on inhospitable ground within ASEAN,"" referring to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations."
Tiglao separately told AFP that Manila would hold talks with Kuala Lumpur on the deportation of the former guerrilla leader turned politician.
"US and Philippine officials say the group has links with Saudi militant Osama bin Laden, blamed for the September 11 attacks on the United States that killed about 4,000 people."
"Malaysia's official Bernama news agency said that Misuari and six of his men were arrested on an island off the Malaysian state of Sabah, which is on Borneo island, while trying to enter the country illegally."
He is the founder of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) group and governor of the Muslim self-rule Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).
He expressed the government's determination to put Misuari in jail.
Tiglao said he had been informed that Misuari was taken to the Sabah state capital of Kota Kinabalu.
"To the United States, what Bustani wanted to do was even more intolerable, as it would disrupt the US plan of launching a military strike against Iraq."
"When questioned by a reporter ""why the United States has supported a certain cold-blooded dictator in Latin America,"" Roosevelt gave a vivid reply: This dictator ""may be a son of bitch, yet he is our (the United States) son of bitch."""
"As for the recent event in which Jose Bustani, director-general of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], was voted out of office at the organization's special plenary session, there clearly existed an ""American background."""
"As for Bustani, he hoped that Baghdad could become a member of the OPCW so that the United Nations could conduct arms inspections in the country."
"Other than that, nothing will count."
"According to New York Times, the United States is inclined to put friendly faces in the Presidential Palace of Latin American nations, no matter whether or not these faces are wearing army uniforms."
Why has the United States been picking on Chavez and Bustani all this time?
Even some major media in the United States have thoroughly unmasked the attitude taken by the US Government towards the cope farce in Venezuela.
"During his visits to some OPEC member states in 2000, he also paid a visit to Baghdad; meanwhile, he has all along maintained a close relationship with Cuba."
"When Chavez resumed power, a senior US official in charge of national security commented that ""Chavez should reflect on himself,"" as ""his ship has been sailing towards a wrong direction for far too long."""
"This special meeting was initiated by the United States, with only one single goal to fulfill, that is, instigating OPCW member states to vote out Bustani."
"On the issue whether the coup farce staged in Venezuela not long ago had an ""American background,"" the world media have made many reports, comments, and conjectures."
"It will not be a ""coup"" so long as the United States thinks it is not!"
"In simpler terms, the interests of the United States are always above everything else, not only above the sovereignty of other nations, but also above the so-called values of ""democracy"" and ""human rights"" that the US always likes to dwell on."
"Both the White House and the US State Department expressed ""satisfaction"" over the stepping-down of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's constitutional president, and no one ""wept over him."""
"Although the White House and the Pentagon have denied supporting the oppositions in Venezuela to stage this coup, the world will not be easily fooled as it can judge from the several official statements made by the US Government both before and after the coup."
"Besides, they also claimed that Chavez ""had only himself to blame"" for the coup."
"At the time when the abortive coup had just taken place, the United States ""did not show the slightest sympathy,"" still less ""the least regret,"" for the breaking-off of Venezuela's democratic system."
"After Chavez took office as Venezuelan president, he has pursued an independent foreign policy, and has been out of step with the United States in many areas."
"It has been reported that the United States had earlier held a secret meeting with a number of countries, promising to pay for their long due OPCW membership fees if they could vote according to the wish of the United States."
"It turns out that in the dictionary used by the United States, the definition of a ""democratic regime"" is subjected to double standards."
All these are eyesores to the United States.
This reminds one of a witty remark made by US President Franklin Roosevelt in the old days.
"They have pointed out: When will a ""coup"" not be called a ""coup""?"
The conspicuous policy of playing games that US officials continue to adopt in their statements proves that the Bush administration is playing the part of a thug who is feared by all and who likes to punish anyone that complains about his behavior.
"The return of Chavez following the failed coup attempts that the United States first blessed and then disavowed represented a tough blow to US policy in Latin America, which is also known as America's backyard."
"Of course, she knew who should learn a lesson from this situation, but she was playing games."
"National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice stated after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez triumphantly returned to power at the request of his own people that she hoped Chavez got the message that his people had sent to him, which is that his policies are not useful to the Venezuelan people."
"Oddly enough, the peoples that US officials like to speak for are the same ones that suffer from unfair US policies, not to mention that those peoples never gave US politicians the right to speak for them."
It proved that the will of the people is stronger than any force or arrogance of power.
"It is worth mentioning that the United States is currently implementing the principle that President George Bush announced following the 11 September attacks, which is that those who are not with him are against him."
"Moreover, US officials have developed a habit of speaking for other peoples and their interests."
It is certainly playing games.
"For instance, Mr. Bush announced recently that Palestinian President Yasir Arafat has betrayed the hopes of his people."
"That is why the coup was planned to overthrow Chavez, who visited Iraq and considered suspending oil exports for one month in protest against the Israeli holocaust against Palestinian civilians."
"Overshadowed by the midst of the tragic events taking place in the occupied Palestinian areas, Venezuela's strong slap on the face of the United States has gone almost unrecognized."
I found the statements made by US officials about the recent developments in Venezuela both ridiculous and odd because they all seemed to be playing games.
It continues to twist the logic of things by turning a blind eye to Israeli murderers and describing Palestinian victims as terrorists.
The United States does not want to learn the lesson.
"The fear of lapsing back into the grim years of military dictatorships and revolutionary guerrilla movements has driven virtually all the Latin American countries, with the notable exception of El Salvador, to condemn the overthrow of the constitutional order in Venezuela."
The Spaniard did not specify whether he had attended that hasty meeting on his country's behalf or on the EU's behalf.
"Though some of them did not conceal their criticisms of Hugo Chavez, the member countries of the organization of American States (OAS) condemned the coup d'etat and recognized the legitimacy of the elected president."
"But the attacks that hit the United States that same day initiated a new era, relegating the defense of democratic principles to a subordinate place behind the priority objective of combating terrorism."
"Of course the American Administration had had contacts with the conspirators for several months, but that was in order to advise them to use constitutional methods against Chavez."
"From Mexico to Buenos Aires, television viewers saw, on the Spanish CNN and Telemundo channels, the undisguised pleasure displayed by White House spokesman Ari Fleischer and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice at the announcement of Hugo Chavez's ""resignation,"" which he never in fact signed."
"From the vantage point of Latin America and the Caribbean, there can be no doubt about the United States' complicity with the military and civilian authors of the abortive coup d'etat against Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez."
"All except El Salvador and the United States, whose representative to the OAS, Roger Noriega, tried for several hours to persuade his opposite numbers that Chavez's ouster was a good thing for the ""hemisphere."""
"Following the sudden turnabout and President Chavez's return to the Miraflores Palace after 48 hours, Washington immediately tried to limit the damage."
"His visits to Iraq's Saddam Husayn and Libya's Muammar al-Qadhdhafi, his friendship with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, his relations with the Colombian guerrillas, his speeches against ""neo-liberal globalization,"" and his commitment to a multipolar world already placed him in the Evil camp, even though the Bolivarian Venezuela has never ceased to guarantee oil supplies to United States, of which it is one of the three foremost suppliers."
"Beyond Latin America, the establishment of a ""friendly"" government in Caracas, representing industry and the conservative circles influenced by Opus Dei, also had the advantage for Washington of weakening OPEC, which Hugo Chavez had succeeded in bringing back to life less than two years ago."
"Far from condemning that which the United States at no time described as a coup d'etat, President Bush's spokesman explained that Chavez had indeed brought it on himself and that he bore the responsibility for the ""confused events,"" having violated human rights."
"A former Ambassador to Venezuela, he has never made a secret of his antipathy for Chavez, who he rightly considers the main supporter of the Castro regime."
"By some ironical trick of history, it was on 11 September 2001 that the OAS member countries, with the United States represented by Secretary of State Colin Powell, signed a new ""democratic charter"" envisaging regional defense mechanisms for the constitutional regimes."
"Otto Reich, the State Department's Latin American policy chief, had indeed met with the short-lived ""interim president,"" boss of bosses Pedro Carmona, but that was in order to urge him not to dissolve the National Assembly."
Fear of Grim Years
"Implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal, a secret operation against the Nicaraguan Sandinist regime under the Ronald Reagan presidency, the Cuban-American, Otto Reich, was appointed Undersecretary of State for Latin American Affairs, despite Congress' opposition."
"Having taken a downward turn following the announcement of the coup d'etat, oil prices have started to rise again since Hugo Chavez's return to the Miraflores Palace."
"This apparent change of doctrine on Washington's part, following some 20 years of demands -- sometimes successful -- for observance of democratic and constitutional order in Latin America, is laden with threats, in a subcontinent which, during the second half of the last century, experienced a succession of coups d'etat, from Guatemala to Chile, via the Dominican Republican and Argentina, fomented or backed by the CIA and the Pentagon."
"On top of this, there are the latest press reports of the presence of one or two American officers among the conspirators..."
"Latin American analysts and commentators read in the New York Times and the Miami Herald that ""subtle and informal messages"" of encouragement had been addressed to the conspirators, as was admitted by an unidentified Pentagon official, and that the CIA was not inactive during the months prior to the coup d'etat, as suggested by Stratfor , a newsletter specializing in intelligence matters and published on the Internet."
One of the first decisions by the government that resulted from the coup d'etat was indeed to suspend oil supplies to Cuba.
"The same advice was issued by the US Ambassador in Caracas, Charles Shapiro, who rushed to the presidential palace, with his Spanish opposite number, to meet with Pedro Carmona."
But he also took the risk that an obsession -- Fidel Castro's downfall -- would exert excessive influence on the conduct of relations with his neighbors in the South.
"By entrusting the conduct of his Latin American policy to the radical wing of anti-Castro exiles, President George W. Bush satisfied the powerful Cuban-American lobby of Miami, which his brother, Jeb, needs in order to secure his reelection as Governor of Florida."
"In the new Manichean world, divided between friends and enemies of the sole superpower, Hugo Chavez was unwise enough to condemn the American bombing raids in Afghanistan."
"The world well remembers how the United States has been calling other countries as violators of human rights, while it has been involved in one of the grossest type of human rights violations."
After pointing its finger of blame at tens of regimes and governments around the world for decades.
"He said that the Americans are treating these prisoners like ""an ostrich""."
"The US President George W. Bush has said that he does not recognize the detainees in Guantanamo military base as war captives, and hence he will not accord them the rights and privileges that they would automatically get under Geneva Convention."
"Washington needs to review its own history of crimes against humanity, especially the non-WASP humanity."
The world is watching how the US is treating the detainees in Guantanamo.
What is non-WASP humanity?
"(John Walker, ""the American Taleban"" has not been taken to Guantanamo because he is not part of the non-WASP humanity)."
The treatment of Al-Qa'idah and Taleban prisoners will go down in history as the most shameful detentions in the history of post-war incarceration in the 21st century.
"The point is that if the United States keeps pontificating and preaching about human rights, it can't suddenly forget about its past lectures to other countries and nations."
"Addressing Friday worshippers gathered at Tehran University, Iran's former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Friday criticized the treatment of Taleban and Al-Qa'idah prisoners in Guantanamo military base in Cuba."
"The former president and current chairman of the Expediency Council said that these prisoners are put in chain, in cages in summer and in winter."
"An international tribunal consisting of experts on international law should decide on this issue, not Mr. Bush whose knowledge of international law leaves plenty to be desired."
"If the United States is truly committed to human rights, it should show it in its treatment of the detainees that it has transported in chain to another side of the globe."
"According to Americans, this sort of humanity does not qualify for any of the laws that have been legislated by international organizations, by any accepted world conventions."
"They neither believe that these prisoners are truly prisoners, nor do they believe that they are ""captives."""
"[Headline of editorial] By Adbolhassan Sobhani ""Pot Calling the Kettle Black"""
Non-White Anglo-Saxon-Protestant humanity is that part of humanity whose eyes are not bluest of the blue and whose hair is not blondest of the blonde.
"This is in no way defending the Taleban or the Al-Qa'idah members, some of whom might be guilty of the most heinous crimes against the poor oppressed people in Afghanistan."
The argument by Bush is that these detainees are members of a terrorist group and hence they do not qualify as members of a defeated country or an army.
The case of the United States is like the case of that pot who called the kettle black.
"Even if we assume that George W. Bush has a point in making this argument, it is not up to him to decide who is a captive or who is not a captive."
"The White House spokesman announced the night before last that the Taleban prisoners being held in Guantanamo will enjoy the treatment envisaged under the Geneva Convention, but not the foreign prisoners from Al-Qai'dah, who the Bush administration considers terrorists."
"Spanish daily blasts ""meaningless"" US announcement on Guantanamo detainees"
It can only be paradoxical that a supposedly model democracy like the USA can trample on the law to such an extent.
"That may be the case, but even the worst criminals have the right to a lawyer and to know the charges against them."
Donald Rumsfeld and other senior Washington officials have tried to justify what is happening in Guantanamo on the grounds that the detainees are dangerous terrorists.
"Nobody in the US government has answered this question, even though international organizations like the Red Cross and Human Rights Watch have denounced the defenceless situation of these prisoners, who have no access to lawyers and do not enjoy the minimum guarantees for judicial proceedings which, in their case, do not exist."
"If they don't enjoy the advantages of being prisoners of war and do not have the right to be tried under US criminal law, what jurisdiction will be used for these men being held incommunicado in a place that isn't the USA or Cuba?"
"The key issue is not so much whether they are treated humanely and their beliefs respected, but their legal status."
"So when the White House says it is going to treat the Taleban in accordance with the Geneva Convention, it is pure rhetoric, nothing other than a public relations exercise and will be meaningless in practice."
"The USA refuses to admit that these detainees are prisoners of war because, under the Convention, they would have the right not to answer any questions except to give their name and rank, they could not be tried except for war crimes and they would have to be repatriated after the war ends."
"Bush's spokesman added that none of the 158 detainees in Guantanamo is going to be given prisoner-of-war status, which makes the apparently positive part of the White House statement meaningless."
"The Geneva Convention is the international treaty signed in 1949 by the USA and other countries, which regulates the treatment of prisoners of war and grants them a set of legal and humanitarian rights."
"BRUSSELS, June 29 (AFP) -- Nearly 100 donor countries and international organizations opened their checkbooks here Friday to bail out struggling Yugoslavia after Slobodan Milosevic's lightning transfer to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague."
"Labus said the United States, which had until the last minute been uncertain of attending the conference, contingent on Milosevic's extradition, pledged 181.6 million dollars during the morning session."
The Stability Pact was launched two years ago to rebuild the region after years of war and communism.
"""We decided to make some bold decisions,"" he said."
"""Nobody is happy when a former president is taken before the tribunal in The Hague, but it had to happen and the sooner the better,"" Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus told reporters on his arrival here."
"Japanese Ambassador to the EU Takayuki Kimura said his country had pledged 50 million dollars, in addition to technical assistance and another 10 million dollars to the whole of southeast Europe, most of it to Yugoslavia."
"""But the costs of failing to support Yugoslavia as it struggles to break with the past would surely be higher still."
The European Commission anounced it had pledged a financial package of grants and loans totalling 530 million euros (450 million dollars).
"""We are in the middle of a very complicated process of changing almost completely our political and economic system...This process is long and painful, but we are determined to win."""
"We are now fully back into the international community, politically, diplomatically and financially, and that's very important for us."
"""There is no quick fix"" to the Yugoslav problem, the World Bank's Johannes Linn said."
"""The possibility of a democratic, stable and prosperous Yugoslavia moving toward integration with Europe is something which we dared not hope for only eight months ago."""
"The donors' conference, co-sponsored by the European Commission and the World Bank, was hoping to raise 1.25 billion dollars (1.47 billion euros) for Yugoslavia this year for urgent repairs to infrastructure and salaries to teachers and other civil servants."
A German source said Germany had pledged 153 million marks (66.32 million dollars).
"""This pledge is in addition to the pledges of individual EU member states that will be made separately at the conference,"" said Gunnar Wiegand, spokesman for External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten."
"Johannes Linn, World Bank vice-president for Europe and Central Asia, said the bank had pledged 150 million dollars for the current calendar year and ""over the next three years we expect to support Yugoslavia to the tune of about 540 million US dollars in concessional loans."""
"Labus said Milosevic's extradition ""is of course a part of the equation,"" but added ""broad economic reforms and democracy that we introduced into the country"" had played a major role."
"""The fact that Milosevic is on the way to be brought to justice is just a signal that my country is ready to respect all international obligations."""
"""A Yugoslavia that has a firm and decisive program of economic reforms in place is and is increasingly integrated into the wider international community is no longer a dream, it is now a reality."""
"In Berlin, Bodo Hombach, coordinator of the Balkans Stability Pact, said several delegations to the Brussels conference told him it was now ""easier and more motivating"" to supply Belgrade with the aid it desperately needs."
"By midday, the conference had garnered pledges totalling some 1.37 billion dollars in grants and low- or no-interest loans over the next three years, against the target figure set by the World Bank of 3.9 billion dollars for what Belgrade would need for the three-year period."
"Linn said that as a result of recent changes in Belgrade, including the Milosevic extradition, ""we will now be talking about Yugoslavia as an integral part of the successful formula of trust for economic recovery in the region."""
"Aside from the financial assistance, said Labus, ""this conference is symbolic for us."
"""We decided to take the fast track to Europe and implement directly the international rules."""
"Labus recalled that his country was recovering from ""a decade of dramatic economic decline, including trade isolation and sanctions..."
"Infrastructure, including power, water, rail and roads, he said, were ""suffering from many years of decay, mismanagement and the consequences of the NATO 1999 bombing campaign"" that ended Belgrade's repression of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority."
The lawyers deemed it wise to do this now because one of Collignon's questions is connected with the juridical consequences of a Lebanese amnesty law.
"On behalf of some Palestinian survivors, lawyers Luc Walleyn and Michael Verhaeghe on 18 June filed a complaint with the Brussels Public Prosecution Office against Sharon and other Israeli and Lebanese persons deemed responsible for the massacres in Beirut."
"Tomorrow, the Chamber for Indictments will begin the debate on Investigating Judge Collignon's questions on the legitimacy of the case against Sharon."
"Lawyers for the survivors, who have filed a complaint against Sharon in Belgium, said this."
"According to Belgian and international criminal law, they could be held responsible,"" Verhaeghe said."
The lawyers refused to reveal the source of the documents.
"It published a report, but not all the documents and interrogation reports were released, because they were deemed damaging to the state's interests."
"It had already been known that Lebanese Phalangist militias, which perpetrated the massacres, cooperated closely with Israel, but according to the lawyers, various documents now indicate that Israel and the Phalange had planned the actions in the camps in advance, that Israel exercised complete control over the militias, and that, in the wake of the massacres, the Israeli army instructed the Phalange to assume responsibility."
Brussels - New confidential documents indicate that current Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the army's former leadership were directly responsible for massacres in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in 1982.
"A few days after filing the complaint, the lawyers received a stack of documents in Hebrew and in English regarding the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the Sabra and Shatila events."
Senior generals and Sharon bore command responsibility [preceding two words published in English] for the militias' actions.
They gave the entire stack to Investigating Magistrate Patrick Collignon.
"In the complaint, Hobeika had not yet been called by name."
"The documents include meeting reports, and intelligence service and interrogation reports."
A ruling is expected by the end of this year or early next year.
The lawyers expect that the Public Prosecution Office will request Israel to confirm the documents' authenticity.
Walleyn are Verhaeghe are convinced of the authenticity of the documents.
"Judging from a few texts that De Standaard was given access to, the documents seem to be related to the Israeli Kahan Commission."
"""In practice, the Phalangist militias operated directly under Israeli command."
This special commission investigated the Sabra and Shatila events in 1982-1983.
"In the meantime, the lawyers have also initiated a civil suit against Elie Hobeika, the militia leader who is regarded as one of the main perpetrators of the massacres."
"Its other provisions include the overhaul and construction of new plants for making fuel elements and the overhaul of ""wet"" nuclear waste storage facilities."
"The programme calls for the overhaul of nuclear power stations with a view to extending their safe and efficient operation, extending the service life of power units, resumption of the construction of power units and compiling a list of promising sites for future nuclear power stations."
"This is one of the provisions of the federal programme Energy-Efficient Economy that covers the period from 2002 to 2005 and sets guidelines until 2010, the Government Information Department reported on Tuesday [27 November]."
"Moscow, 27 November: Russia intends to modernize and extend the service life of 11 power units in its nuclear power stations by 2005."
"The construction of nuclear power stations in Iran, China, India, Kazakhstan and Ukraine will provide 42bn dollars in 2002-2005 and 24bn dollars in 2006-2010."
"When nuclear power stations account for nearly 20 per cent of total energy generated in the country, nearly 52bn cubic metres of gas will be saved in 2005 and 65.5bn cubic metres in 2010."
It will increase by 3 GW in 2002-05 and by 4.81 GW in 2006-10 to 30.05 GW.
"In the next stage, 2006-2010, the efficiency of existing nuclear power stations will be stepped up by increasing the utilization of current capacity, extending their service life and increasing capacity by using new-generation power units In 2005, the capacity of all Russian nuclear power stations should total 25.24 GW."
"The Bush administration fears the treaty will have a negative effect on its economy and maintains that developing countries, such as China and India, should also be subject to mandatory emission targets."
"If industrialized countries start cutting back on GHG emissions from 2008, when the first target period begins, South Korea will become the seventh most carbon dioxide-producing country in the world, according to IEA figures."
"In order for the protocol to be implemented, it must be ratified by at least 55 parties, including enough industrialized countries to represent at least 55 percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions in 1990."
"Until then, we plan to step up efforts to gradually change our energy structure and reduce greenhouse gases by promoting research on renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies,'' he said."
"As South Korea is not included in the Annex I parties, composed of industrialized countries, the accord, which is expected to go into effect some time next year, is not likely to affect the country for a while."
"In terms of the amount of emissions, South Korea discharged 410 million tons of carbon dioxide in 1999, ranking tenth in the world."
"According to statistics released by International Energy Agency (IEA), a Paris-based agency affiliated with the OECD, South Korea was found to have recorded the highest growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions in 1999, showing a 75.5 percent increase since 1990."
"Jun Mu, deputy director of the industry and environment team at the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), said, ``So far, industries have been rather passive in dealing with emission reductions, as is has been something that was considered to lie far off in the future."
``We estimate Korea will probably join the countries cutting back emissions no later than 2018.
"A total 43 countries have ratified he treaty so far, with Korea yet to ratify."
"``We will first start gathering the opinions of business leaders regarding Korea's ratification of the treaty, while continuing to promote the development of energy-efficient technologies,'' he said, adding a special committee on climate change was formed under KCCI last January."
"Last Saturday, representatives of 165 countries finally agreed on the rules to implement the 1997 Kyoto Protocol after two weeks of negotiations held in Marrakech, Morocco."
"But the government has not taken any concrete steps regarding the cutback of greenhouse gas emissions, maintaining a wait-and-see approach instead."
"But considering that South Korea has the highest growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions in the world, it will not be able to fend off international pressure to join in the global campaign to reduce greenhouse gases much longer, experts note."
"According to the accord, about 40 industrialized countries must cut or limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases by an average of 5.2 percent from 1990 levels by 2012."
"Scientists believe these ``greenhouse'' gases (GHG), which mainly result from burning fossil fuels, raise the earth's temperature and change the climate by creating floods, droughts, and other abnormal weather phenomena."
"The international treaty to tackle climate change was first envisioned in Kyoto four years ago, but due to the conflicting interests of developed and developing countries as well as other contentious issues such as emission reduction mechanisms and targets, it is yet to go into effect."
"The protocol faced danger of being shelved altogether, when the U.S, which is responsible for one-fourth of all CO2 emissions in the world, decided to abruptly withdraw from the climate change treaty last March."
"But due to the strong initiative of the global community, led by the European Union, countries agreed on a set of rules to implement the climate change treaty _ with or without the U.S."
"With international consensus having been reached regarding a treaty to combat climate change, a ``red light'' has been issued to South Korea's heavily carbon-dependent industries."
"``As South Korea has `developing country' status, we are not in a position to voluntarily express our course of action,'' said Yoon Jong-soo, director of the global environment office at the Environment Ministry."
"Although a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), South Korea is still regarded as a developing country and is not obliged to reduce its GHG emissions under the treaty."
"""We are ready to give sincere and earnest consideration to any effort that will contribute to stability and peace in Afghanistan,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue told reporters."
"""Together with the international community we are ready to work for regional reconciliation in Afghanistan and for regional stability,"" she said at a regular ministry briefing."
The issue of peacekeepers in Afghanistan has attained renewed urgency this week following rapid advances by the opposition Northern Alliance against the ruling Taliban militia.
Her remark was in response to a question on whether China would be willing to participate in a multinational peacekeeping force in Afghanistan.
"China has played a tiny role in a handful of recent United Nations peacekeeping actions in various parts of the world, including Cambodia."
Zhang said the Chinese government was not yet in direct contact with leaders of the Northern Alliance.
"BEIJING, Nov 15 (AFP) - China on Thursday said it did not rule out taking part in any international peacekeeping force to maintain stability in Afghanistan."
"PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Nov 1 (AFP) -- About 1,000 armed Pakistani tribesmen crossed into Afghanistan on Thursday to fight with the Taliban against the United States, witnesses said."
"They crossed the border at Bajaur agency in North West Frontier Province on 50 vehicles, the witnesses said."
"The fighters were led by Maulana Mohammad Ismail, leader of the radical Tehreek Nifaz-e-Sharia Mohammadi."
Taliban vehicles were waiting on the other side of the border in Afghanistan's Kunar province.
"But the ill-disciplined alliance troops showed little-disguised irritation at the Americans' dominant role at Bagram, refusing to allow journalists through to speak to the US soldiers."
"A contingent of the US 10th mountain division has taken up base at Bagram, joining some 150 British Marines, to establish a humanitarian air corridor for international aid but also to ensure security at the crucial airbase."
"""They don't want their people to see pictures of foreign troops in Afghanistan,"" he said."
"But Russia, which armed the alliance throughout its five-year civil war with the Taliban, has offered unequivocal political support for the loose coalition of ethnic minorities which swept into Kabul on November 13."
"It is good, you can see they (the Americans) are here,"" he said smiling."
"Ironically, some 200 armed Russians, who appeared to be from the military although they were dressed in uniforms of Russia's emergencies ministry, set up camp 10 days ago in the centre of Kabul."
"But then asked about permission to visit the base, Babajan replied: ""You have to talk to the Americans, they're in charge here."""
"BAGRAM, Afghanistan, Dec 7 (AFP) - In a foretaste of resistance to foreign peacekeepers by the Northern Alliance, an uneasy atmosphere reigns between US forces and their Afghan allies at the Bagram airbase north of Kabul."
The US military will not say how many troops they have brought to the base but their presence has already provoked an armed incident.
"The balance of authority became clear when the general invited journalists to accompany the military convoy, an order swiftly countermanded by the US officers."
"A few feet (metres) ahead down the road, British commandos are on guard duty."
"Under the power-sharing accord signed in Bonn on Wednesday, which should see a new interim government take power on December 22, a mainly Muslim UN-mandated security force is to be deployed in Kabul."
A group of journalists who toured Bagram accompanied by US soldiers on Wednesday were halted in their tracks by a burst of gunfire by alliance soldiers next to their vehicle.
"At the checkpoint, five US soldiers armed with M-4 carbines were manning the post, assisted by a sniffer dog."
"""We have the same caps as the Soviet soldiers, that brings back bad memories for the Afghans,"" said Cordell."
"He said that Northern Alliance commanders were irritated by images of armed US soldiers on Afghan soil, and so media access to the base had to be temporarily suspended."
"Once the main Soviet airbase during Moscow's 1979-89 invasion of Afghanistan, Bagram has now become the hub for flights into the country as Kabul's own airport cannot be used because of unexploded US bombs."
"The top alliance commander in the area, General Babajan, driving out of the base to inspect positions along with some US and British officers, good naturedly shrugged off any problem."
Moscow said they are there to help re-establish its embassy and deliver humanitarian supplies.
"""Our cooperation?"
However Northern Alliance defence minister General Mohammad Qasim Fahim said the same day that he had rebuffed a British offer to send troops to Kabul in the coming days and insisted he wants a strictly limited UN force.
But the spokesman also admitted that the US troops reminded the Afghans of the Soviet military invasion.
"""By no means are we trying to set up a permanent presence here, we just want to help,"" said US military spokesman Sergeant-Major Ray Cordell."
"Although Northern Alliance control the main entrance to the base, some 60 kilometres (35 miles) north of Kabul, just inside the perimeter there is a checkpoint manned by heavily-armed US soldiers."
"""When it gets to the point that Northern Alliance troops start firing in the air just next to a car with reporters, you have to do something about it,"" said Cordell."
"Packages of the relief goods, collected by the Asia Africa Cooperation Environment Center (ACEC), went through customs in Osaka."
"On Friday, ACEC shipped some 200 kilograms of the 50 tons of relief goods it has collected."
"They will be shipped to Islamabad on Tuesday from Narita airport, east of Tokyo, ACEC officials said."
"Osaka, Dec. 7 Kyodo -- A Japanese nongovernmental organization (NGO) in Kobe shipped relief goods such as blankets and sweaters to Afghan refugees at refugee camps in Pakistan on Friday to help them endure the severe winter weather."
"At the request of the Red Crescent Society of Pakistan, ACEC has called for donations of relief goods on its Web site since early November."
"The rest of the goods will be shipped by sea early next year, the officials said."
"ACEC is also calling for monetary donations because it needs more money to pay shipping costs, the officials said."
"Over the years, China has emerged as a key economic partner and an important source of external assistance for Pakistan."
The annual trade between Pakistan and China hovers around $1 billion.
"Bilateral agreements regarding the Saindak copper and gold projects, Thar coal mines development, technical and economic cooperation, and a joint revolving fund for scientific research, and other hydroelectric projects are likely to be signed during the visit."
"The President and Chinese leaders will review Pakistan-China relations with special focus on bilateral economic cooperation, regional issues including Afghanistan and Kashmir."
"The President will hold bilateral talks with the Chinese leaders, including President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu Rongji, and Mr. Li Peng, chairman of National People's Congress."
The visit will mark the climax of the events organized in connection with the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
"President Pervez Musharraf will pay a state visit to China from 20th to 24th of this month at the invitation of the president of China, Mr. Jiang Zemin."
"The dismissal in Venezuela of Minister of Interior and Justice Luis Miquilena, who up to that point had been the central figure in the process that put Hugo Chavez in power, again triggers the red light in those countries which, like Argentina and Colombia, border on Brazil."
Bad government management complicates any situation.
Eight hundred firms have closed their doors.
"When the price of petroleum fell the first time, the Venezuelan economy went down the drain."
The moderate wing supports dialogue with the opposition to try to reduce political tension.
The changes made by Chavez in his team expose the cracks in the coalition.
Half the active population is in the informal economy.
"The noise from the pots and pans does a poor job of hiding the opposition's desire to launch a kind of civil disobedience, an indication that Venezuela has finally entered a dangerous stage."
"It was to be expected that the new laws--a consequence of the economic crisis--would have different effects on the union leaders, radical left-wing politicians, and populist militants represented in the government."
"The electoral path followed by Chavez when his attempt at an open coup failed may now be the aperitif for the probable ""democratic coup"" that is being prepared from the inside out."
Venezuela's economic situation forms a wretched background for the ideological experiments of the Bolivarian Constitution that Chavez got approved by plebiscite.
"From election to election and plebiscite to plebiscite, Venezuela is moving rapidly toward a ""legal coup"" that may be the logical consequence of the clashes inside Miraflores Palace."
"As the opposition raises its head, the climate of plots takes shape."
"Those laws affect almost everything in the country, from petroleum to land ownership."
Over $200 billion in royalties was squandered with no benefit at all for the population.
"Chavez' short but tumultuous time in power, which he achieved by electoral means following a failed mutiny, arouses fears concerning the future of Latin America's oldest democracy."
"That situation has changed considerably since Chavez issued, by decree, a package of 49 laws of a nationalizing character."
"Shortly after that, on the occasion of the attack on the twin towers in New York, Chavez said that the US reaction to Taliban terrorism was also a terrorist act, thereby straining his relations with Washington."
"It has long been known that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has influence on Chavez, who has asked him for advice more than once."
"Dramatic things may be happening in the Venezuelan situation, and it is more than time for Brazilian diplomats to take notice of South American necessities."
"All of that stands in brutal contrast to the 1970's, the decade of the petroleum boom, when Andres Perez was the ""socialist Little Father."""
The worst recession in recent decades has been alleviated only by the recent increase in petroleum prices.
"While on the outside the population expresses its discontent with resounding pots-and-pans demonstrations, cracks are appearing inside the government among the 13 parties that supported Chavez in his rise to political power."
The US Government itself considers him a kind of link for dealing with the situation in Venezuela.
"In response to the reaction in the street, the radical wing opposes any agreement with opposition groups."
Cde Mugabe said there could never be any election anywhere in the world without any incident.
"Cde Mugabe said the Government would do everything necessary to ensure the holding of a free and fair election, as it had done during all the previous elections conducted in the country since the attainment of independence in 1980."
"He cited as an example the case of British deputy Prime Minister, Mr Prescott, who punched a protester who had hit him with an egg in the run up to the general elections in Britain last year."
"On the other hand, the union was quick to enter into alliances with countries such as Uganda and Rwanda, which had no tradition of democratic polls."
Cde Mugabe expressed satisfaction with the Government's preparations for the election so far.
"The Government has accused Britain of being a player in Zimbabwe's internal politics, saying it would therefore not be an impartial observer."
Cde Mugabe said the poll would be held in the same way the Government has held other elections since 1980 despite statements by some Western governments that it will not be free and fair.
The EU was demonising Zimbabwe despite the fact that the country had a tradition of regular and democratic elections.
"Cde Mugabe said recalling the supreme sacrifice paid by Zimbabweans in their struggle for self-determination and the pride they take in exercising their sovereign right to elect a President of their choice, the Government would do everything necessary to ensure that they exercise their democratic right without interference from any quarter whatsoever, whether internal or external."
"""We know how to campaign, we know how to appeal to our people...we know how to improve the lot of our people, we know what we have planned for our people for the present situation, we know what we have planned for them for the future,"" he said."
Britain has of late been at the forefront in calling for sanctions against Zimbabwe through the EU and the suspension of the country from the Commonwealth.
"Since he announced the dates for the Presidential election on January 9, the Government had taken steps and set on course various processes to facilitate the holding of a smooth electoral process."
Presidential Reporter - PRESIDENT Mugabe yesterday invited foreign observers from various international organisations and some individual countries to come and observe the forthcoming Presidential election but will not allow observers from Britain.
"Although the President did not say why the United Kingdom, the former colonial power was not welcome to send observers, relations between Zimbabwe and Britain have soured over London's interference in Harare's internal affairs through its sponsorship to the opposition MDC party."
"""My Government will, as is its practice, be accrediting foreign journalists through our embassies to cover the forthcoming election on the basis of the country's laws and regulations."""
"Asked about his chances in the poll, Cde Mugabe said he was representing a party that had seen years of experience and had won parliamentary and presidential elections before."
"""In West Africa, they say make you no mind"" (do not mind them)."
Poll observers invited
"He said this would create an atmosphere conducive to the holding of a free, fair and peaceful election."
"""In line with Zimbabwe's tradition of holding open democratic elections, my Government will be inviting, among others, the following organisations and governments to send observers to witness the electoral process and see the people of Zimbabwe proudly exercise their sovereign right to freely elect a President of their choice: 
	
	
 ""The Organisation of African Unity/Africa Union (OAU/AU); the Southern Africa Development Community (Sadc); the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (Comesa); the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas); the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM); the Commonwealth, excluding the United Kingdom; the joint ACP-EU delegation (excluding the United Kingdom) and led by the ACP; the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) from the United States of America; individuals and countries to be invited in their own capacities include the Federal Republic of Nigeria,'' he said."
The same countries had also violated international law by invading the DRC.
"I do not remember any election at all when their pronouncements were fair?"""
"The President also appealed to all political parties, churches, war veterans, farmers' unions, trade unions, business associations, media houses, women and youth organisations and civic society to come together and exchange views on ending political violence."
"The election, he said, will once again underline Zimbabwe's established democratic tradition of holding regular parliamentary and presidential elections since the attainment of independence as provided for by its Constitution."
Sadc and Nigeria will be invited to send their observers immediately.
We will proceed with our election in the same way as we have proceeded.
"Cde Mugabe told journalists at State House in Harare that the joint ACP/European Union and Commonwealth teams, which have been invited to observe the March 9 and 10 presidential election should not include Britain, which has been accused of interfering in the internal politics of Zimbabwe."
How does this affect Brazil?
"Their economic agenda alone is overwhelming,"" comments one high-ranking member of the Brazilian Government."
"It requires the creation of a Central Bank capable of administering a floating exchange rate system and a regime of inflation goals; the establishment of a safety network for the debilitated financial system; the restructuring of the tax policy, and the elaboration of a law that ensures fiscal discipline."
"Not to take into account the impact of destabilization in South America in a world already complicated by the Middle East, India versus Pakistan, Afghanistan, and badly-resolved problems in Eastern Europe, ""is not to have a strategic vision,"" according to the assessment that is being made in Planalto Palace and which was clearly emphasized during Lafer's meetings with Powell, Zoellick and Evans."
"Argentine society is divorcing itself from political parties and national institutions, and it is in such an environment that radical responses germinate, such as authoritarian regimes and the formation of guerrilla groups."
"Powell's reaction, according to a Planalto source, was one of ""interest and attention""."
The Brazilian Government's perception of Argentina's future is pessimistic.
The Argentina theme was also covered in Lafer's talks yesterday with Commerce Secretary Don Evans and with US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick.
"South America is already living with complex problems in Venezuela and, above all, in Colombia, where President Andres Pastrana is unable to combat the guerrilla activities of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] and failed in the recent attempt to negotiate an agreement with its militants."
"Foreign Minister Celso Lafer transmitted a warning to United States Secretary of State Colin Powell, with whom he spent 30 minutes yesterday, from the Brazilian Government: without help from the US, Argentina could enter a state of social rebellion and open a new front of geopolitical instability in South America."
"And there is no guarantee that a political destabilization of the region would bypass even Chile, where memories of the military dictatorship are still very strong."
"To add a country like Argentina to this list of problems is to allow the growth of a dangerous focus of social dissatisfaction, which is tending to express itself outside of any institutional control."
"If I do not save them, I do not save myself."""
"political and diplomatic argument in the conversations with representatives of the Bush government that transcends the economic-financial discussions, to which the subject was restricted, and which encompasses the very survival of democracy in South America."
"One cannot ignore the fact that, only 20 years ago, all these countries - including Brazil and Peru - were ruled by generals."
"In his conversation with Secretary of State Colin Powell, the Brazilian Foreign Minister stated clearly that to leave Argentina to its own fate, as seems to be the George Bush administration's choice, is to pave the way for social rebellion there, which will contaminate other countries on the continent and create another area of political instability on the planet."
"""La plata"" or social rebellion"
"It is a new approach, which tries to sensitize US authorities through the use of geopolitical arguments."
"The ill effects of the Argentine crisis can contaminate the nearest countries first, like Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia."
"""This is the minimum that has to be done."
"What is underway in the neighboring country, according to information gathered by the Brazilian Government, is the establishment of a Central Bank - which 10 years ago abdicated from the traditional functions of currency and credit manager - that is capable of working with a floating exchange rate system and a regime of inflation goals, like Brazil's Central Bank; a safety network for the financial system whose health is already extremely undermined; the restructuring of the tax policy so that the tax collection machine can create conditions for the government to draw up a budget without so many uncertainties; and a fiscal responsibility law that imposes some discipline on the relationship between central government and the provinces."
There is an entire.
"For Brazilian diplomacy, Pastrana lost time and credibility on a failed bet: the negotiations with FARC, letting them control territory the size of Switzerland in the heart of the continent."
The Brazilian Government's perception of Argentina's future is pessimistic.
"According to a Planalto Palace source, the reaction from Powell as well as from Evans and Zoellick was of ""interest and attention""."
"This is the understanding of sources very close to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and it is also guiding the analyses of the economic department."
No more than that.
"There is a stress factor in the content and volume of the needs of that country, which on its own will not be able to take the steps absolutely necessary for its reconstruction."
Foreign Minister Celso Lafer carried a dramatic warning from President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to the US Government.
Nothing more.
"Without US help, via the IMF, the country will not be able to attain the most basic economic, social and political stability, and could contaminate the subcontinent, Lafer warned."
"Alone, and under the command of a president who managed to create a strong political coalition explained only by his own survival instinct, Argentines will be unable to attain the most basic economic, social and political stability."
"""Their economic agenda alone is overwhelming,"" the source commented."
"To answer a question of this nature, the Brazilian Foreign Minister would surely resort to Ortega y Gasset: ""I am I and my circumstances."
"Translating roughly, what Minister Lafer tried to tell the Americans is that the financial cost of an international rescue of Argentina, now, led by the IMF and other multilateral credit agencies, will be lower than the cost of fighting, later on, chaos in its social, political, and - why not? - military forms on the continent."
Brazil started using an inflation target once its 1999 devaluation stabilized the real and achieved low inflation.
"Renes is working alongside a group of technicians from the IMF, World Bank, US Treasury Department, and Central Bank of Brazil, whose services were also used during the crises in Mexico and Indonesia."
"If an agreement is reached with the IMF and economic conditions improve, the timetable will likely be moved forward so that people can get cash."
"The same will go for secured loans under $300,000 and personal loans of up to $10,000."
Cavallo could think of nothing better than the curbs on withdrawals.
The outflows forced some banks to ask the government to set limits.
"Some analysts feel that the fledgling Duhalde administration is making a mistake by ending convertibility without first resolving the problems that will arise from this decision, which was a foregone conclusion here in Argentina and the rest of the world."
They managed to keep their bonds in foreign currency and are supposed to start collecting interest this April.
"This measure will benefit only the 4 percent of workers who earn more than that amount, which until now was subject to the restrictions."
One of the points on which the Duhalde administration's economic plan will be based is a monetary benchmark that will govern the issuance of pesos and the refunding of deposits in dollars that have been frozen in accounts.
"""No withholding on oil exports: In conclusion, the government has decided to reverse itself on the 20 percent tax that it was planning to levy on these exports."
"What is more, the IMF tried to convince Cavallo to abandon the one-to-one peg in an orderly fashion."
"The danger, which the economic team is aware of, is that any additional money withdrawn will go straight into purchases of dollars since this could represent the percentage of income that an individual is able to save."
"It will not be easy, of course, to drum up demand with the country in full-fledged default."
"It has been confirmed that there will be ""coupons"" for savers who want to buy things, with their frozen funds as collateral."
"They can be used, though, for smaller transactions or to pay for part of a purchase."
"""Bonds in dollars to compensate banks: The banks will receive long-term government bonds in dollars as compensation for the losses that will arise from conversion into pesos on their balance sheets."
"To this end, Jorge Remes Lenicov's economic team has developed an index or formula including such parameters as projected annual inflation rates, the government's budget, the exchange rate of the dollar, and issuance of money by the Central Bank."
"Debts of more than $300,000 will continue to be converted at 1.4 to 1."
"Under these restrictions, which were established by Domingo Cavallo and tightened by his successor, Jorge Remes Lenicov, the country's savers are barred from accessing more than 65 billion (pesos and mainly dollars) that they have on deposit."
"'We would not have raised all that much money and would have been sending a very bad signal overseas by discriminating between sectors,' acknowledged a senior source in the Economy Ministry."
"They wold rather hold a financial claim on the government than place the entire burden on their debtors, who would be forced to declare bankruptcy if they got no relief."
"Its last show of support was the $8 billion in aid to support the ""zero deficit"" tactic."
"Mortgage loans, the debts of small and mid-sized companies, and automotive loans under $100,000 will be paid back in the identical amount of pesos."
"Everything depends on the anticipated aid of between $15 billion and $20 billion, which is what has been requested of Washington."
The monetary benchmark that Brazil employs and that Chile used to is the most common one in today's world and is based on an inflation target.
"The amount of money issued thus winds up being a function of these variables, not a target in itself, so that monetary policy can be used as a tool for promoting economic recovery."
"The idea is to issue very short-term bills (30 days, for now) that will be indexed to any ongoing depreciation."
"The possibility of keeping a portion of a time deposit in dollars, which President Duhalde has requested, has not been altogether ruled out, but there are legal problems with implementing it."
Lack of confidence led to massive withdrawals of savings into safer places.
Burdensome Legacy
"The 12, 18, or 24 installments into which time deposits will be divided, depending on their amount, may be endorsed."
Transfer of the time deposit will be authorized only in the case of a purchase.
On the basis of this target a rule is developed to determine the interest rate needed to hit the target for price rises.
"""Issuance of bonds indexed according to the value of the dollar: The Central Bank will soon start issuing bonds in pesos to offer the public another alternative to purchasing dollars."
Duhalde will confirm that $2 billion will be made available immediately to mitigate the social disaster.
The banks have also agreed with this option.
"""Total release of salary direct-deposit accounts: All employees will soon be able to access their entire salary by making cash withdrawals from savings accounts."
The big drawback to this system is that hardly anyone will be willing to sell real estate for peso-denominated installment checks that can be cashed sometime in the future.
"The government explained that it theoretically saw tools like the ""unidad de fomento"" as a way of adjusting the deposits of savers that will remain subject to restrictions until at least next year."
"The Central Bank will intervene in the market, but only to prevent sudden swings."
"According to former Minister Roque Fernandez, it was ""the worst mistake in the history of the Argentine economy,"" while influential businessman Arnaldo Musich (FIEL [Latin American Economic Research Foundation]-Techint) considered it an ""inexcusable"" mistake."
Adjustment Index Will Be New Variable
"Barring last minute changes, no announcement is expected about allowing the peso to float freely, as the IMF would like, or about changes in the timetable for easing bank withdrawal restrictions."
"It is likely, however, that before that the government will move ahead with a comprehensive debt rescheduling, including international and local investors who were involved in the first phase of the swap.""]"
"The dollar will be allowed to float as soon as possible, as the government has promised the IMF."
"This constraint, combined with the difficulties of even withdrawing money for daily use from salary direct-deposit accounts, has heightened social unrest, as people have staged marches, banging on pots and pans, and other demonstrations to protest the prevailing economic situation."
Tomorrow the government will announce a comprehensive economic and social plan based on the complete elimination of the dollar as a monetary standard through the conversion of deposits and loans into pesos.
"Once they have been converted, the refund timetable for dollar deposits will initially be maintained."
Another possibility is to have released at least the $2.6 billion that has been pending disbursement since December in order to bolster reserves before the peso is allowed to float.
"""Deposits to be converted into pesos at 1.4 to 1: Time deposits in dollars will be converted into pesos at the official rate."
"The fact that the former minister and President Fernando de la Rua, who later stepped down, were opposed to such a move drove the IMF even further away from lending any support."
"For those owing less than $100,000, the conversion will be done at the rate of one to one."
"Therefore, it can be used only to purchase items such as cars and apartments."
"In other words, refunds will not begin until January 2003."
"The index will persumably not be applied for another two or three months, and it has not been ruled out that it may include loans already converted into pesos."
"But not until tomorrow, one month after taking office, will it announce a comprehensive plan to overcome the worst crisis in the country's history."
"This will completely eliminate the ceiling of 1,500 pesos per month that had been set in the January version of the banking restrictions."
"If any withholding arrangement is implemented, it will apply to all exports, not just some."
"In any event, the oil industry may be asked for an advance on taxes due, as had been under consideration a couple of weeks ago."
It cannot be credited to demand deposit accounts.
"Monetary adjustments were based on what was called the ""unidad de fomento,"" an indexing system that included various price indices and adjusted contracts in accordance with actual changes."
Until August of last year Chile had an incremental adjustment mechanism that included an exchange rate band with a ceiling and floor.
"The banking restrictions will, for the time being, remain unchanged, but the tacit assumption is that the timetable for easing them will be speeded up ""as soon as conditions permit."""
The president will also break down the budget for the press and promise to issue currency in a controlled manner (not to exceed 3.5 billion pesos) and to undertake the difficult task of reversing the sudden decline in wealth (4.9 percent) without pushing inflation beyond 15 percent.
"The rest of his remarks will be solely about the economy, about which millions of Argentines have been obsessed for some years now."
"But since the negotiations will take several weeks, as Remes will not be flying to Washington until 14 February, the idea is to move ahead before receiving international aid."
"For those who owe between $100,000 and $300,000, the conversion rate will be 1.2 to 1, with the government making up the difference between this rate and that of the official dollar."
"Raising the withdrawal ceiling in the case of regular savings accounts to 1,500 pesos a month was under consideration yesterday, but for now the limit of 1,200 a month will continue to apply, with the possibility of gradual increases in the near future."
"The president will also mention imminent political reform, which he will call on Congress to enact."
But the account holder will not be able to move it from one bank to another.
"Such budgetary discipline turned out to be impossible, thus shattering the rigid convertibility system and putting entire sectors of the economy out of commission."
"""Phase 1 of the swap remains in dollars: Banks, Pension and Retirement Fund Management Companies, and insurance companies exerted strong pressure to prevent all accounts from being converted into pesos at 1.4 to 1."
Estimates are that under the arrangement that has been devised the red ink will total more than 12 billion pesos or some $6 billion.
"This system, which will serve as a financial tool for redrafting most of the contracts involving economic activity in the new, post-convertibility era, is similar to the ""Celic"" index that Brazil uses or the ""Unidad de Fomento"" that Chile used until August 2001."
This money was approved by the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank.
"Debts over these amounts will have to be repaid at 1.4 to 1, although the government will defray 20 cents on the dollar so that debtors will actually pay 1.2 pesos."
"[Buenos Aires Ambito Financiero in Spanish on 1 February adds the following: ""The following are the main measures that will be announced tomorrow: 
	
	
 ""'Dirty' float for the dollar: The decision has been made to abolish the official exchange rate (1.4 pesos to the dollar) and to move towards a single, floating rate."
The last of the provisional governments that took over from the abbreviated De la Rua administration decided quickly to end the currency board system.
"In the case of time deposits in pesos, the refund timetable is being maintained; it provides for withdrawals in cash as of March."
"It will help out the banks, as El Cronista reported, by giving them a bond or certificate against future revenues from the tax on crude oil exports (5 billion) and with part of the assistance that the IMF will reportedly provide (4 billion)."
"Intermediate solutions have been completely ruled out, such as periodic adjustments of the exchange rate (a crawling peg) or a band, which would oblige the Central Bank to intervene by selling dollars to defend a given value of the peso."
The measure is designed to send a signal so that people gradually regain confidence.
"Accompanied by Remes, he will talk tomorrow about what the assistance will be used for: to fulfill the promise to create a million jobs, to provide basic health care, and to undertake small infrastructure projects."
An arrangement with an attractive implicit interest rate could also be devised.
The government wanted to wait until it had sealed an accord with the IMF before going to a float.
"""Installment checks for time deposits: The money subject to a refund timetable may be used for purchases, but with restrictions."
"The volume leader was machinery maker Yuken Kogyo, which shot up 28 yen to 152 yen."
"Snow Brand Food, listed on the Second Section, also shed 7 yen to 85 yen."
Brokers said chip-related issues in Tokyo got a boost from an international trade association saying North America-based manufacturers of semiconductor equipment saw orders and shipments rise in December.
"Mitsui Construction rose 1 yen to 46 yen after a daily newspaper said Wednesday that the company and Sumitomo Construction will soon begin negotiations on integrating their business operations, a report later denied by the companies."
Some chip-related issues such as Tokyo Electron and Advantest ended the morning higher despite an overnight fall in U.S. stocks.
"In Osaka, the near-term March Nikkei 225 index futures contract advanced 40 points to 10,090."

"""The Nikkei is fluctuating at a level which induces buybacks for technical reasons,"" said Kazunori Jinnai, general manager at the equity department of Daiwa Securities SMBC Co."
Sumitomo Construction ended unchanged.
"The Nikkei climbed 50.18 points, or 0.50%, to end the morning at 10,101.16."
"Rubber makers and nonferrous metal firms led the rise, while telecoms, real estate companies, and banks were soft in the morning."
"The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) of all First Section issues was down 2.73 points, or 0.28%, to 982.40."
"The Second Section index shed 17.02 points to 1,675.10 on a volume of 7.06 million shares."
"The TOPIX hit a session low of 977.42 in early deals, falling below the post-bubble closing low of 980.11 logged on Oct. 15, 1998, for the first time in four trading days on an intraday basis."
"The Nikkei's downside was supported by buybacks and bargain-hunting in reaction to the previous day's 2% fall, which left the index only a step away from the 10,000 line."
"Tokyo, Jan. 23 Kyodo -- The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average managed to stay above the 10,000 line Wednesday morning thanks to gains by some semiconductor-related shares and automakers."

"It should have worked to eliminate injustice, instead of trying to harass other countries for national prejudices."
"The lumping of Iran, Iraq and North Korea as 'axis of evil' by President Bush has certainly not raised US image."
"It has rather tarnished it, since the international community expects a mature, compassionate and civilised conduct from the United States as the only superpower in the world."
NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson said in New York that credible evidence will be prerequisite for NATO's support for any military action against the three nations.
Let Middle East be the test ground for US sincerity to fight terrorism.
Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that Bush has made a 'big mistake' by lumping the three nations together as they are different from each other.
Its unfettered support to Israel is based on injustice and this distortion in its policies needs to be removed to ensure its own security as well as that of its allies.
"President Bush is intolerant to the dissent to his policy of domination in total negation of the lofty principles of morality, ethic and democracy, which he assertively holds so dear to his heart."
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said after meeting US Vice President Dick Cheney in Washington that there is no evidence of weapons' proliferation against these nations to substantiate the US charge.
Fight against poverty alone will not be a productive effort to fight terrorism.
French officials said that the rhetoric of good and evil is not suitable for the realities of today's world.
It's injustice that breeds hatred and revolt.
"Washington is, in fact, treading a path of coercion, intimidation and blackmailing against the smaller and weaker nations."
"If terrorism is to be fought successfully, the United States should better withdraw its support to the forces of injustice, tyranny and oppression in the world."
"The world expects a civilised conduct from the United States in place of arrogance, discrimination and injustice."
"It should have been on the side of the smaller and weaker nations, rather than targeting them one by one in the pursuit of its global agenda."
"President Bush's projection of Iran, Iraq and North Korea as 'axis of evil' and his threat of military action against them has evoked world-wide criticism."

That statement immediately caused extensive controversy.
"The other day, Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov said: ""It is unacceptable to Russia to mechanically extend the scope of antiterrorist action to any country, including Iraq."""
"It was brutal and reeked of blood, turning the whole world upside down."
"However, even if they did have this kind of weapons, who would dare to use them against the United States, the world's number one nuclear nation, either directly or indirectly through terrorists, while risking the danger of being completely annihilated?"
Their cause was an unjust one and therefore had little support.
"As to whether or not they have developed weapons of mass destruction, all three countries have denied it, but the United States does not believe them."
"At present, very few in the international community have responded in favor of the theory of ""evil axis,"" because many countries, including China, have made clear their stand against willful expansion of the war against terror."
"It seems that the market for the theory of ""evil axis"" is still limited."
"That is why many people suspect the purpose of the United States' putting Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK in the box of ""evil axis"" is to prepare public opinion for possible strikes against these old foes under the banner of fighting terror."
"That being the case, why has the only superpower in today's world insisted that they are the new ""axis of evil?"""
"But so far, there has been no conclusive evidence indicating that the government of any of them was involved in the ""11 September"" incident of terrorist attacks that happened in the United States last year."
"Moreover, Iran made a clear stand in support of the war against terror after the incident."
"According to President Bush, all these three countries ""sponsor terrorism"" and attempt to ""develop weapons of mass destruction."""
"In fact, even the US ally, Britain, and other Western countries have indicated that the antiterrorist military action should be conducted with restraint, for otherwise the danger of losing control will emerge."
The answer should be negative.
"Quite on the contrary, these three are all developing nations and have experienced slow economic development because of sanctions imposed by the West, so there is no chance of them boosting their military strength significantly."
"Actually, these three countries do have one common denominator, i.e., that their values and polices do not agree with those of the United States and none of them are on good terms with the United States."
"It goes without saying that the three countries mentioned reacted strongly to it and other countries also found it very abrupt, so they all started trying to decipher the message within."
"They were destined to collapse, disintegrate, and meet with a total failure; their reputation was ruined in historical records; and they earned eternal notoriety."
"In particular, Iran and Iraq are at loggerheads with each other to this day."
"In terms of strength, these three countries cannot be mentioned in the same breath as Germany, Italy, and Japan in the 1940's."
"Obviously, the ""title"" of ""axis"" is something in international relations that every country would do anything to avoid, so Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK naturally want to clean themselves of the dirty water that someone else have thrown on them."
That military alliance was powerful and constantly on a quest of expansion.
"Beijing, 3 Feb (Xinhua)-- In his recent State of the Union address, US President Bush quite unexpectedly labeled Iran, Iraq, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK] as an ""axis of evil."""
"At the mention of the word ""axis,"" one would inevitably be reminded of the military alliance formed by fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan during World War II in the 1940's."
"Furthermore, the Russian side has stressed time and time again that the United States' accusations against Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK should be settled within the UN framework and raised objections to any hostile action against these three countries without authorization from the Security Council."
"Does an ""axis of evil"" really exist in today's world?"
"To form an ""axis,"" it is imperative to form an alliance, but there is no alliance whatsoever among Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK."
The decision apparently aims to make Seoul the primary negotiator in talks with Pyongyang.
"Afterwards, Bush's aides downplayed the severity of Bush's words, saying the administration seeks negotiations with the North, not war."
"In addition, Bush will discuss ways to further the three countries' support for the U.S.-led anti-terrorism campaign and extend its mission beyond Afghanistan."
This will be Bush's first visit to Seoul since his inauguration early last year and his third meeting with President Kim.
"Visiting China Feb. 21-22, Bush and Jiang will address follow-up steps for China's recent entry into the World Trade Organization and the struggle against AIDS, besides the North Korea issue."
"While in Tokyo from Sunday to Tuesday, Bush is likely to support Koizumi's economic reform efforts and express U.S. willingness to help Japan regain its economic vitality."
Bush's Asian trip was initially scheduled for October last year but was delayed due to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States and subsequent U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.
"The North Korea issue flared up after Bush labeled North Korea, Iran and Iraq an ""axis of evil"" in his Jan. 29 State of Union address, taking issue with their alleged attempts to secure weapons of mass destruction."
The two met in Shanghai last October and in Washington last March.
"During the Kim-Bush summit, the Kim administration will convey its plans to the United States."
"North Korea has likened Bush's ""axis of evil"" remark to a declaration of war."
Bush's Asian trip could serve as a turning point for his government's North Korea policy.
"In a related development, the Seoul government reportedly decided to resume talks with North Korea to deliver the concerns of the United States and the international community about its weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons."
"The two leaders will also address North Korea's conventional military posture, while reconfirming their traditional cooperation in dealing with North Korea."
"The Feb. 20 talks between President Kim Dae-jung and Bush will focus on U.S. charges that the North is developing weapons of mass destruction for export to other ""rogue"" nations."
"Seoul, Feb. 14 (Yonhap) -- North Korea will be one of the key agenda items for U.S. President George W. Bush during consecutive stops in Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing from Feb. 17-22, diplomatic experts said Thursday."
"Seoul, Tokyo, Beijing and Washington all have interests in resolving the North Korea issue."
North Korea will also likely come up when Bush meets Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
"On Tuesday night, Kasyanov will wind up his Mongolian tour and leave for Vietnam for an official visit."
"On Tuesday, 26 March, Kasyanov will address Russian and Mongolian entrepreneurs and visit Science and Technology University."
He is also expected to be awarded the title of honorary doctor of the university.
"Russia exports petroleum products, electricity, machinery and equipment to Mongolia and imports copper concentrate and meat."
"Russia's Ambassador to Mongolia Oleg Derkovskiy believes that there are no problems in relations between the two states and the common border stretching for 3,500 kilometres is a border of peace and good neighbourliness."
The turnover of goods between Russia and Mongolia has reached 240m dollars.
"The official programme of Kasyanov's stay in capital Ulaanbaatar will begin with a tete-a-tete meeting with Mongolian Prime Minister Nambaryn Enhbayar on Monday, followed by talks in an extended format and signing of several agreements."
"Besides this, the Russian prime minister is scheduled to meet with Mongolian President Natsagiyn Bagabandi and the parliamentary speaker, Sanzhbegiyn Tumur-Ochir."
"Moscow and Ulaanbaatar are continuing a political dialogue, actively developing bilateral trade, and consulting each other on international problems where their stands coincide or are close."
"At the same time, the ambassador said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that large Russian capital and businesses ""are not active enough in dealings with Mongolia"" at the moment."
"Moscow, 24 March: Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov is departing for Mongolia on Sunday afternoon [25 March] on an official visit, the premier's press secretary, Tatyana Razbash, told ITAR-TASS."
Moscow has expressed the wish to import more Mongolian meat.

"It is also a binding decision taken by the professional associations' general assembly, after Jordan sealed a peace treaty with Israel in October 1994."
"They also lambasted ""US-British aggression on Iraq and meddling in its internal affairs."""
"During Sunday's conference, nine papers were discussed."
"According to Council of Unions' president Mohammad Oran, the anti- normalisation drive remains an Arab, Muslim and human goal."
"Jordan has delayed sending its ambassador designate, Abdul Ilah Kurdi, to Tel Aviv."
Former Hamas spokesperson Ibrahim Ghosheh and spokesperson for the Muslim Brotherhood Jamil Abu Baker took part in the conference.
"On the official level, relations between Jordan and Israel have been strained since the outbreak of the Intifada 16 months ago."
"More than 50 participants, most of them members of the unions' Anti-Normalisation Committee, took part in the one-day conference, held against a backdrop of uncertainty as to the future of the 10-year-old peace process."
"AMMAN -- After months of low-profile activities, the 14 professional associations held their first anti-normalisation conference on Sunday during which they renewed calls for severing all ties with ""the Zionist enemy."""
"Conference participants warned against Israeli ""expansionist plans"" and argued that the peace treaty was in favour of the ""Zionist enemy."""
"Sunday's gathering is the first such public event since authorities cracked down early last year on the anti-normalisation committee after they made public a blacklist of Jordanians they claimed had established ""ties with the Jewish state."""
"""Normalisation with the Zionist enemy is a crime against the country, nation and humanity,"" read one of the banners hoisted at the Professional Associations Complex."
The conference also honoured the families of Jordanian detainees in Israeli jails.
"They called for ""ostracising"" those who deal with Israeli partners and maintaining a total boycott of the Jewish state at the grassroots level."
The speakers outlined the plight of the Palestinians under occupation and the suffering of Iraqi people facing crippling international sanctions for the eleventh consecutive year.
They will be carried to the ISAF deployment area by a C-130 Hercules aircraft.
Romania has put a C-130 Hercules aircraft at the ISAF's disposal for transport operations in the aforementioned zone.
"Through our special correspondent Doru Dragomir who will accompany the Romanian contingent, Ziua will keep its readers informed about the way the Romanian detachment will arrive in Kabul and the first missions the Romanian soldiers will carry out in the ISAF framework."
Two additional transports will carry the other soldiers (a total of 48).
"The Romanian soldiers are military police and will be in charge of escorting, patrolling, protecting humanitarian convoys, and controlling access points."
The first 12 Romanian soldiers will leave for Afghanistan this evening.
"One can imagine how Rumsfield, who is ordinarily so sure of himself and of his jokes, might have gone off his rocker once and, for an hour, could have ranted and raved against the ""hyperbole,"" the exaggeration that, according to him, marked the reactions generated by this photograph, and reminded the world about the degree to which the US attitude was ""humane, legal, and proper."""
"And that the Europeans, in particular, are no longer quite ready to follow the Americans in their way of thinking."
"That, however, is the problem."
"Until now, this right-this right right, if one prefers-has more or less been accepted by Washington's partners."
"Washington officials refuse this school of thought (which would lead them to refrain from interrogating the prisoners, indeed to release them after the end of the hostilities) but seem to be aware of the fact that here they are not on very solid legal ground."
"""Bush is quite close to pulling off the impossible: losing the sympathy of the civilized world for the United States,"" an astonished The Daily Mirror wrote."
"Even certain US newspapers, led by The New York Times , have hinted at some doubts about the Pentagon's attitude."
The distress generated by one photograph published inadvertently or through excess self-confidence might only mean that this consensus is in the process of eroding.
"Throughout this Afghan campaign, there have been some other slightly troubling images."
"But, however, they were under medical supervision, their heads shaved, and enjoying hygienic and food conditions that were very superior to what they could have known in Afghanistan."
The End and the Means
"That, in theory, would seem to make him a prisoner of war par excellence if Washington were now not confusing the Taliban regime (which the US has destroyed, but without declaring war on it) with Al-Qa'ida's terrorist network."
"At the end of a brilliantly waged and very carefully framed war, punctuated by briefings that had brought Donald Rumsfeld, the Defense Secretary, a veritable media triumph, there was this one image too many."
"Since 11 September, the US has behaved as if it had a sort of natural right to create law."
"There is now, in a sort of provisional epilogue, this quasi-Orwellian image of totally dominated men deprived of the use of their senses."
"But perhaps there is something else, deeper, more diffuse."
"One must not confuse ""justice and vengeance,"" lest one lose one's ""moral advantage,"" European commissioner Chris Patten explained."
"Some real, concrete, like those of these fighters in rags, haggard, who were the survivors of weeks of bombing."
"In the commentaries of newspapers that were the most well disposed toward the United States ( The Daily Telegraph and The Times of London), in the very remarks by certain officials from the ""coalition,"" the reactions, quite particularly in Great Britain, the US's top ally in Afghanistan, have ranged from incomprehension to indignation, from slight confusion to high distress."
"There have also been, based more on intuition than on images, doubts about the match-up between the end and the means, and the admiration, mixed with fear, that an implacable force generates, that of US missiles and airplanes in action."
"This ""legal"" aspect of the debate is now quite well known: the prisoners taken on the ground are considered to be ""illegal combatants"" by the Americans and not prisoners of war."
"Such could be the lesson drawn by the Pentagon and the White House from the hue and cry that has been provoked in the world by the release of the now famous photographs of blinded, gagged, chained, and kneeling prisoners in their enclosure at the Guantanamo camp."
"Only US officials know (or think they know) who these men are whose identities have not been made public: according to certain US media, the most ""important"" of the Guantanamo prisoners is reportedly the Taliban army's chief of general staff."
It was a photograph taken by a US soldier and officially disseminated by the United States Navy on a Defense Department Internet site.
"Because they had been the victims of terrorist attacks and, more deeply, because Americans are ""good,"" even if, as President Bush had explained, the world did not always realize ""how good they were."""
"""Illegal Combatants"""
"Those of members of the US special forces, equipped with all their panopoly of soldiers of the future and, this arresting contrast, those of their ""auxiliaries"" from the Northern Alliance, barefoot, wearing sandals and in the snow, at the entrance to caves they were responsible for cleaning up."
"Big Brother, even democratically elected and at war against evil, is perforce a bit scary."
"All this for a single photograph, something that, after all, was quite neat and tidy, in which men are seen dressed in gleaming suits and modern, civilized instruments of coercion (blinding eyeglasses, masks incapacitating the mouth and nose, ear-splitting ear phones)?"
"So an edifying photograph, or viewed as such, but one which, the explanation is, in fact is deceiving: the prisoners were reportedly photographed shortly after their arrival, that is, if one understands this correctly, they were shackled and blinded as they had been during the 27-hour trip from Afghanistan to Cuba."
"Just as is the fact that ""the"" US Al-Qa'ida fighter, John Walker Lindh, will not be shut up in one of the four square meter cages at Guantanamo but sent to a US prison and tried by a normal court."
"Other more virtual ones (because in this case the communication was better monitored) of Marines protected with surgical masks and gloves transporting prisoners chained to stretchers to planes, as journalists from the print media were able to see them using binoculars."
You can never be too sure about what you are communicating.
"So Rumsfield stated that the prisoners' treatment was ""reasonably consistent"" with the Geneva Conventions, which was a way of saying, in this particular case, that the US was the only judge of what was ""reasonable."""
"The solidity of this argument, though, has increasingly been demolished, by, among others, the Red Cross, which thinks that, until proof (legally established) of the contrary, the prisoners should be considered prisoners of war."
"""They are not POWs, they are unlawful combatants,"" Rumsfeld told reporters at the US Naval Base."
Rumsfeld has asserted repeatedly that the detainees are getting good treatment and refused to grant them war prisoner status.
Rumsfeld's itinerary for his trip to Camp X-ray at Guantanamo included a tour of the facilities and meetings with military leaders and US troops who are keeping watch over the 158 Afghan war detainees there.
"""They will not be determined to be POWs."""
"Human rights groups and some European countries, including Britain, Germany and France, are upset over the Bush administration's refusal to classify the detainees as prisoners of war, which would give them the protections of the Geneva Conventions."
"Washington, January 27 (XINHUA) -- US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld arrived at the US Naval Base at Guantanamo, Cuba, to get a firsthand look at the detention camp for Taliban and al-Qa'ida members."
"The addition to passports is a move that the leader of the Taiwanese authorities has long premeditated, carefully planned, and gradually implemented."
This is really an unwise idea.
The United States has made a commitment that it will not change its Taiwan policy.
"Its harm is not limited to the incident itself, but lies in the fact that it is an important step for the Taiwanese authorities to promote its ""gradual Taiwan independence."""
"In November, he manufactured the so-called ""three acknowledgements and four suggestions"" and then claimed that the two sides of the strait ""are not subordinated to each other, and do not represent each other."""
This caused strong opposition from all the various aspects.
It is worth special attention that the mainland's stance on the Taiwan issue is very clear and has never changed.
"In fact, the economic difficulties in the island, the political deadlock, and the public's confidence crisis should be the agenda for the Taiwanese authorities' top concern."
"Recently, the Taiwan ""Press Bureau"" stopped using the symbol with the map of China."
"In his 2001 New Year's speech, he proposed the ambiguous ""conformity theory,"" which takes the tone of unification but promotes independence in nature."
"In May 2000, ""Taiwan independence"" activist Yao Jiawen claimed in Tokyo, Japan that the Taiwanese authorities instructed its ""Foreign Ministry"" to change the English translation of the ""People's Republic of China"" on passports to ""Taiwan,"" and name all overseas agencies ""Taiwanese"" agencies."
"However, one month later, he changed his tone and said that the ""92 consensus"" was a ""consensus"" without any consensus."
President Bush will visit China soon.
We should maintain sharp vigilance on this move.
"The promotion of ""gradual Taiwan independence"" by the leader of the Taiwanese authorities is from his misjudgment of two situations: the internal situation and the external situation."
"If the Taiwanese authorities cling obstinately to its course and continue its steps of ""gradual Taiwan independence,"" they will only intensify cross-strait relations and will certainly eat their own bitter fruit."
"All these activities to ""change the name of Taiwan,"" along with the Taiwanese authorities' comprehensive policies of ""separating from China"" in ideology, culture, history, education and the media, are all attempts to separate Taiwan from China, and change its status as a part of China."
The Taiwanese authorities had to respond in low key.
"Instead, they should replace it with the symbol of the ""national flat."""
"As early as in 2000, the Taiwanese authorities notified various departments, including the Taiwanese ""Foreign Ministry,"" to use the ""official"" symbol of Taiwan in name tags, seating plates, menus, guest books, writing paper and invitations, and avoid using the symbol of the ""national emblem."""
"The leader of the Taiwanese authorities once made the commitment of the so-called ""four noes and one will not"" when he took office in May 2000."
"In August, he preached again that ""unification is not necessarily the only and final choice."""
"We should notice that the addition to ""passports"" is not an isolated incident."
"Irresponsible promotion of ""Taiwan independence"" and intensification of cross-strait ties are definitely not blessings to Taiwan."
"The purpose is to create conditions for the final public announcement of ""Taiwan independence."""
"The development of these events fully indicates that the leader of the Taiwanese authorities has not only not given up his stance of ""Taiwan independence"" but also used the method of nibbling to promote ""gradual Taiwan independence."""
"Taiwanese authorities concerned forced a Taiwanese NGO to change the word of ""China"" in its English annual."
"This is another dangerous signal of the leader of the Taiwanese authorities promoting ""gradual Taiwan independence"" and an attempt to split the motherland."
"Support from Lee Teng-hui and overseas ""Taiwan independence"" forces makes him believe that ""the situation is great."""
"Now, the Taiwanese authorities wants to add the English word of ""Taiwan"" on Taiwanese travel documents."
Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.
"On 13 January, the leader of the Taiwanese authorities proudly announced at a gathering of pro-""Taiwan independence"" elements that beginning this year Taiwanese travel documents would have an addition of ""Taiwan"" in English."
"The mainland has the greatest sincerity of peaceful unification with Taiwan, and also strong determination and necessary preparations for preventing ""Taiwan independence"" and all separatist activities."
"He claimed that this was a ""gift"" to ""Taiwan independence"" groups."
"In May 2001, he claimed that his ""conformity theory"" was not really for unification, nor it was for conformity."""
"If it is absolutely not feasible, they should use the symbol of the ""plum blossom."""
"At the same time, the leader of the Taiwanese authorities gradually promoted the so-called ""correcting the name of Taiwan."""
But the Taiwanese authorities exaggerated Sino-US conflicts and placed hopes on seeking benefits from such conflicts.
"The ""four noes"" are pledges ""not to declare independence, not to change the national title, not to push for 'state-to-state relations to be included in the constitution, and not to promote a referendum to change the status quo in regard to independence;"" and the one will not is ""will not abolish the guiding principle of national unification and the National Unification Commission."""
"Externally, Sino-US relations are increasingly improving."
"On 19 June, leaders of the Taiwanese authorities met with ""legislators"" of the Democratic Progressive Party and expressed publicly for the first time that the addition of ""Taiwan"" in English on ""passports"" was ""imperative."""
"Internally, he considers the ""legislative"" election last year as the public's recognition to his idea of ""Taiwan independence."""
"Any type of ""Taiwan independence"" is absolutely not permitted."
"Even though this was the first time Vladimir Putin had visited the center, people at the Khrunichev firm have considered him their ""godfather"" since last January when the president confirmed the center's current general director, Mr. Medvedev, in his position."
Vladimir Putin's visit to the Khrunichev center proved to be not only instructive but also very pleasant for the Russian president.
"Unlike the vast majority of the former giants of Russian industry, the center is an entirely successful enterprise now too."
The center is responsible for implementing the main programs connected with Russia's participation in the International Space Station (ISS) project.
"In the future, Russia is planning to gradually transfer all launches from Kazakhstan's Baykonur onto its own territory."
"According to Rosaviakosmos Head Yuriy Koptev, he and his colleagues had ""informed the president"" of their wish that the program for the development of the Plesetsk space center be given federal status."
"During a visit yesterday [21 January] to the Khrunichev State Space Scientific Production Center Vladimir Putin said that ""Russia will not be able lay claim to a worthy place in the civilized world"" or ensure its own defense capability if it abandons its space programs."
"In order to avoid any misinterpretation, the president let it be understood that the Kremlin is full of resolve to maintain both Russia's place in the civilized world and its defense capability at the proper level."
"Finally, the center is connected with the most promising space programs, which envisage the creation of an completely new family of Angara carrier rockets, the first of which should launch from the Russian Plesetsk space center next year."
"Incidentally, the president was reminded about ""space sovereignty"" on Monday before his visit to the center."
Vladimir Putin was insistently asked to tackle another of Russia's space problems yesterday.
"These funds allowed the Plesetsk launch pad, which was built in Soviet times to launch the Ukrainian Zenit carrier rockets, to begin to be re-equipped for the upcoming Angara and as well as the establishment of an entire ground infrastructure for launching light Rokot space carriers, remodeled from SS-19 ballistic combat missiles."
The Proton family of rockets the Khrunichev center produces is one of the most popular commodities on the international market for the launch of heavy carriers.
"This is connected both with considerations of economy ($115 million has to be paid every year just to lease Baykonur) and with the problem of the country's ""space sovereignty"": After all it is only possible to guarantee to ensure the launches of commercial devices from your own territory."
The size of the center's hard-currency earnings since its foundation in 1993 is nearing $2 billion on commercial space-device launches alone and the center's annual budget exceeds three billion rubles.
"Incidentally, the money earned by the Khrunichev center has given serious support to the existence of Russia's main space center in recent years."
"During the talks with his Turkmen colleague that took place immediately before it, the head of state had to discuss an agreement to pay Ashgabat financial compensation for the use of so-called ""fall sites"": Three Turkmen regions (with a total area of over one million hectares) on which the spent rocket stages fall after being launched from Baykonur (the stipulated size of payment for a single use of the regions comes to around $70,000)."
"But Putin vetoed it at the last minute -- by law, the center's general director is appointed by the president personally."
It is one of the most successful space-rocket firms not only by Russian criteria but by world ones too.
"After the center's previous head, Anatoliy Kiselev, resigned ""for health reasons,"" the enterprise had almost been headed by former Rosvooruzheniye Head Aleksey Ogarev, who is bound by good relations to Boris Yeltsin's family."
"After this, the center's general director, Aleksandr Medvedev, said that Mr. Putin ""is devoting significantly more time to cosmonautics than any of the country's previous leaders"" and for this showed him examples of the space-rocket equipment produced at the enterprise."
Space remains a Russian national priority.
"According to the parties' lawyer, Rateb Juneidi, the court presided by Judge Abdullah Hadad, examined the charge sheets and arguments presented and adjourned until Dec. 31."
"Political parties and professional associations have also moved to contest several temporary laws including the one on public gatherings, as well as amendments to the Penal Code"
AMMAN (JT) -- The Higher Court of Justice on Monday held the first session of a case filed by opposition parties contesting the recently endorsed temporary Elections Law.
"The Opposition Parties' Higher Coordination Committee had contested the temporary law on Sept. 16, on the grounds it was ""unconstitutional."""
"The parties argued that there were ""no emergency circumstances"" warranting the enactment of a temporary law on elections."
"The Constitution allows the executive branch to issue temporary laws in the absence of Parliament, provided there is a ""state of emergency."""
"The law, which clarified voting procedures but maintained the controversial one-person, one-vote formula, was endorsed by the government in July, just over a month after the dissolution of the Lower House. "
"The financial impact of operations in Afghanistan, which are expected to mobilize some 5,000 men, will not take effect until 2002."
Paris -- The French Armed Forces' operations abroad in 2001 will have entailed an overspend of 3.290 billion Francs [Fr].
"The expenditure has not increased much from 2000, since during that year it totalled Fr3.255 billion."
"Outside Afghanistan, and outside Africa, under the terms of its defense agreements, France has deployed in 2001 some 10,750 members of its Armed Forces and of the gendarmerie, most of the personnel being stationed in Kosovo (5,890) and Bosnia-Herzegovina (2,820.)"
"The problem, he went on, is that the so-called ""one China"" principle cherished by Beijing ""makes the Republic of China vanish."" Therefore, as a guardian of the ROC sovereignty, dignity and security, he cannot accept the principle."
The nation's top mainland policy planner also assured her guests that the government's policy toward mainland China will remain unchanged after the ruling Democratic Progressive Party emerged from the recent legislative elections as the island's largest party in the Legislative Yuan for the first time.
"Tsai made the remarks during a meeting with a delegation of the ""Committee of 100,"" a New York-based non-partisan association of ethnic Chinese celebrities."
"While meeting with the ""Committee of 100"" delegation Monday, President Chen said ""one China"" is an issue that can be discussed in the future with mainland China."
Tsai said cross-strait dialogue is not expected to resume overnight.
"In her view, Tsai said, both sides have been endeavoring to prevent the results of Taiwan's recent parliamentary and local government chief elections from affecting the stability of cross-strait relations."
"Chen also told the visiting members of the overseas Chinese group that the so-called ""one China"" was originally not a problem according to the Republic of China Constitution."
"""The two sides must forge mutual trust and work out certain procedures to ensure that talks are conducted on a solid basis,"" Tsai noted."
"Noting that President Chen Shui-bian has on many occasions expressed goodwill to mainland China, Tsai said so long as Beijing leaders can carefully mull the significance of Chen's statements on cross-strait affairs, particularly the ""one China"" issue, there should be opportunities for the two sides to resume talks."
Tsai left for the United States Tuesday evening to brief American scholars and politicians on Taiwan's political situation and policy direction in the wake of the Dec. 1 elections.
"Taipei, Dec. 11 (CNA) -- Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said Tuesday she foresees the possibility of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait resume dialogue next year."
"""It all depends on how mainland China interprets President Chen's latest remarks on cross-strait relations and how the two sides cultivate an environment favorable for resumption of their long-stalled dialogue,"" Tsai explained."
"However, Chen said ""one China"" should not be a precondition for talks until such time as Taipei and Beijing have reached a mutually acceptable meaning for the the term through ""wisdom and creativity."""
"Tsai said although the spokesman for mainland China's Taiwan Affairs Office failed to give any positive response to Taiwan's goodwill in his first post-Taiwan election news conference, he appeared to be fully aware of the importance of maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait."
Washington is already under fire from human rights groups for its treatment of prisoners captured in Afghanistan and held at Guantanamo Bay.
"""One cannot neglect the fact that BiH, as member of the United Nations, is obliged to strictly respect the UN resolution dated September 28 last year, which obliges UN members to cooperate on the plan of exchange of information and cooperation on prevention of terrorist activities,"" read a statement from the team."
"SARAJEVO, Jan 18 (ONASA) -- The decision on extradition of six Algerians to the United States is in accordance with the responsibility and authorities of the BiH Federation bodies and international obligations, the coordination team for anti-terrorism said in a statement on Friday [18 January]."
"The United States has not given the captives the status of prisoners of war, which would grant them certain rights under the 1949 Geneva Convention."
US soldiers form a substantial part of Bosnia's NATO-led peacekeeping force.
The US embassy said the suspects would be treated humanely and in accordance with international law.
"Earlier, the US embassy in Sarajevo said in a statement: ""The six Algerian nationals who have been detained by BiH (Bosnia and Herzegovina) authorities since mid-October have been transferred to US custody."
Five of the six also held Bosnian citizenship but were stripped of it after their arrest.
"""We have taken custody of these individuals due to our concern about their activity in BiH, which both posed a credible security threat to US personnel and facilities and demonstrated involvement in international terrorism,"" it said."
He said the government had not been aware of the ruling by Bosnia's Human Rights Chamber that measures should be taken to stop four of the suspects being taken out of the country.
A Bosnian government official insisted the appeal had already been rejected and legal procedures had been followed.
The Supreme Court of Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation ruled on Thursday there was no reason to detain the six.
"""The plan is to move them to Guantanamo Bay,"" the US official said, without specifying when."
"In Washington, a senior official told Reuters the US military planned to quickly move the six to the American Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where al-Qa'ida and Taliban detainees from the war in Afghanistan are being held."
"Bosnian authorities have handed over to US custody six Algerians detained in October on suspicion of involvement in terrorism but ordered released this week by a local court, the US embassy said on Friday."
"Washington insisted it would not have acted without credible evidence, but the transfer exposed it to more criticism from campaigners who have accused it of disregarding human rights in its declared ""war on terror."""
Not only had a court ordered their release on Thursday but the state's top human rights body had instructed authorities to prevent four being taken out of the country by force.
"""It violates the rule of law."""
More than 100 protesters gathered outside Sarajevo's central prison on Thursday night.
"The men had appealed against that decision, however, and Rees said they should not have been deported until that process was complete."
"Local police arrested them in October, acting on a US tip after threats closed the US and British embassies for several days."
"All were Algerians, although one also had a Yemeni passport possibly obtained fraudulently, international officials said."
"""The legal procedure in this case has been fully respected so far,"" said Jusif Halilagic, a deputy minister who represents the government in the chamber."
International officials said US officials had not been willing to provide Bosnia's justice system with the intelligence information that prompted their detention.
"""It's very disappointing,"" Madeleine Rees, head of the Bosnia office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said of the operation."
They tried to block vehicles presumably taking the suspects to hand them over to US forces.
The six have been accused of having links to the al-Qa'ida network of fugitive Usama Bin Ladin.
"A Bosnian government official said legal procedures had been respected in the case, but a senior UN human rights officer in Bosnia said they had been ""trampled over."""
"""For us there cannot be special courts."
"ICRC envoys are discussing with US officials whether to release the number of detainees and their nationalities, said Christen."
"The ICRC plans follow up on prisoners if they are transferred again later, and try to gain access to new arrivals in coming days."
"Darcy Christen also said that among the prisoners transferred to the US navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were three British citizens and possibly some French speakers."
"The US has caused controversy by stating the detainees are ""unlawful combatants"" and have no rights under the Geneva Convention."
"""If a doubt exists as to the status of a person, this doubt must be decided by a tribunal acting on the basis of judicial guarantees,"" he added."
"""It is important to be able to repeat these visits,"" he said."
"The findings from the visit, which got under way on Friday and is expected to last at least one week, will be presented directly to US authorities, Christen told reporters."
"As long as this confidentiality will allow us to get results in the humanitarian sphere we will keep to it,"" he said, adding it would be the first of a series of visits."
"The ICRC considers, however, that they are prisoners of war protected by the Third Geneva Convention of 1949."
"Christen said ""detainees from the battle field"" did not exist as a category under humanitarian law, adding that in an international armed conflict anyone captured on the battlefield was presumed a prisoner of war."
"GENEVA, Jan 18 (AFP) -- A report by delegates from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), currently visiting prisoners from Afghanistan held at a US base in Cuba, will remain confidential, an ICRC spokesman said on Friday [18 January]."
"The four-member team, which includes a doctor, will inspect conditions and treatment of the increasing number of Taliban and al-Qa'ida prisoners arriving at the base from Afghanistan."
"""Confidentiality will be respected in this case."
"However, the Geneva-based ICRC did not know the number nor the nationality, he said following a comment on Thursday that there could have been French nationals among them."
"Asked about special courts to be set up by the Bush administration to try the al-Qaeda detainees, Christen pointed out the courts were not yet operating and their procedures were still unknown."
The number of detainees being held at the isolated US military outpost on Cuba's southwestern coast rose on Thursday to 110 after the arrival of another 30 prisoners from Afghanistan.
"We want to avoid expeditious justice,"" he said."
They arrived overnight.
"A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""I can confirm a team of British officials are in the process of visiting the detainees at Guantanamo Bay."
"LONDON, Jan 18 (AFP) -- British officials have arrived at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and are assessing the conditions of three British prisoners among the 110 suspected al-Qa'ida fighters held there by the US, the Foreign Office said on Friday."
A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair refused to say how many British officials had travelled to the camp.
A four-member International Red Cross team flew into the US navy base on Cuban soil on Thursday and was due to begin interviewing detainees later Friday.
"They have a mat to sleep on and two towels, one to be used as a prayer rug."
"The prisoners are being held at a temporary outdoor detention facility called ""Camp X-Ray"" where each has a separate cell with a concrete floor, wooden roof and chain-link walls."
"London insists it supports US reassurances that the men are being treated humanely, although there has also been criticism here over why it was taking diplomats so long to see the men."
"""They are going about their task that has been set for them, identifying those who claim to be British citizens and reporting on the welfare of those who claim to be British citizens and assisting the US authorities with legal inquiries into the terrorist atrocities."""
"The United States earlier this week said British diplomats could have access to Britons held among the detainees, whose cramped and spartan conditions have caused much criticism among human rights groups around the world."
"The United States is greatly responsible for the slow settlement of the Taiwan issue and for the ""Taiwan independence"" forces running rampant."
This will have a certain impact on the US Government's readjustment and implementation of policies toward China in the future.
"Not only today, 10 years ago or even in the early days of China's reform and opening up, the broad mass of the Chinese people, young college students in particular, know about US values."
Both the Chinese and US sides hold that the visit has achieved positive and successful results.
"The US Government should earnestly abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques and relevant commitments, and properly handle the Taiwan issue from a strategic and long-term perspective."
"The Chinese people not only understand American democracy, freedom, religions, and human rights, they also know quite well about American social, economic, and political problems, which is beyond Bush's imagination."
"Hong Kong's public opinion hold that Bush's visit to China is like delivering a message to the ""China threat"" advocates in the US Republican Party: Now is the time to engage China in a positive manner."
"But the 11 September event makes Bush aware that the major enemy of the United States is terrorist groups, that US security is threatened, and that without support from other big countries, it will be difficult for the United States to win the war against terrorism."
This is to show the world that Sino-US relationship continues to move ahead from the existing basis.
"On 22 February, in a speech at Tsinghua University, Bush again stated that ""it is very hard for me to use words to describe the earth-shaking changes in China."""
"In addition, during his stay in China, Bush expressed ""admiration"" and ""surprise"" on several occasions regarding the development and changes in China in recent years and on China's tremendous development potential."
The Taiwan issue was made prominent during Premier Zhu Rongji's meeting with Bush and in the questions posed to Bush by Tsinghua students.
"That's why a student asked Bush yesterday how to handle social problems including the problem of the violation of human rights, which is getting worse day after day in the!
 United States."
"In front of the TV camera, Bush stepped several steps forward from the spot where Nixon had stood."
Hong Kong public opinion pointed out that this shows that the Chinese Government and people are extremely concerned about and dissatisfied with Bush's remarks on the Taiwan issue.
The US Government should realize that the Taiwan issue is the most important and most sensitive core issue in Sino-US relations.
He wanted Chinese officials to show the places where Nixon had stood when he made the ice-breaking visit to the Great Wall 30 years ago.
"Bush then rediscovered the importance of China -- a big country on the other side of the globe -- and tries to develop ""constructive cooperative relations"" with China since it is in accord with US strategic interests."
"There is a saying that ""people in the world work so hard to pursue gains."" That Bush chooses to increase contacts with China shows that it is impossible for the United States to deal with global issues alone, nor can it afford to ignore China's major role in international affairs."
Bush hopes that Jiang Zemin would mediate with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the US' behalf so that the United States can resume talks with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
"Regarding the major contents and purpose of Bush's speech at Tsinghua University, it was, as overseas public opinion had expected, a promotion of US values to China."
"A Ta Kung Pao editorial pointed out that obviously Bush did not make these remarks out of courtesy to the hosts, but that development and changes in China did indeed leave a deep impression on Bush and his party."
Hong Kong media also generally maintained a positive stance toward the trip and welcomed the visit.
"We see that Bush stopped referring to the ""strategic competitor"" remark during his visit in China, since a confrontation between the two biggest countries on both sides of the Pacific brings no good to world peace and economic development."
Bush's visit to China has been a success.
"This is of vital importance to the situation in the Taiwan Strait, to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as to the healthy development of Sino-US relations."
"Hong Kong, 23 Feb (ZTS) -- US President Bush concluded a two-day working visit to China, during which he exchanged in-depth views on Sino-US relations and on major international and regional issues with the Chinese leaders, and reached extensive and important consensus."
"When he revisited the Great Wall, he could hardly hide his excitement."
"In an editorial, Wen Wei Po noted that 30 years ago Nixon developed strategic relations with China due to the US strategic interests and to the need to deal with the Soviet Union, the United States' biggest enemy."
"Thirty years later, the United States now considers itself the world's sole superpower."
The United States appreciates the role that China plays in helping solve the conflict between India and Pakistan.
"In an editorial, Hong Kong's Shang Pao pointed out that in the course of reform and opening up, the United States is a country that the Chinese people want to understand the most and that the United States is a country that is easiest to understand."
"This should be a message for the authorities as concerns the stand the country has taken on this issue,"" Director of the Institute of Politics Mykola Tomenko told a press conference in Kyiv today."
"For instance, 29 per cent of those who consider themselves ""poor"" support America and 46 per cent do not, while among those with ""high"" and ""average"" income levels 39 per cent approve of US policy and 45 per cent disapprove."
"""Afghanistan is a historic memory for a whole generation of our compatriots and that is why they fear being drawn into the conflict."
Poll shows more Ukrainians against US campaign in Afghanistan
"Kyiv, 29 December: Forty-three per cent of Ukrainians disapprove of the antiterrorist operation being carried out by the US in Afghanistan, according to a poll of 1,000 Ukrainian citizens conducted by GfK-USM at the request of the Institute of Politics between 25 and November and 5 December."
"At the same time, over a third - 34 per cent - support America's military campaign."
"The lower the living standards of those polled, the less frequently they spoke in support of the US campaign, Tomenko said."
"The committee said in a joint statement at the end of the 
meeting that it will try to have the framework finalized at the 
China-ASEAN summit in Cambodia at the end of this year."
"The framework is expected to cover a wide range of areas of 
co-operation in goods, services and investment."
"Chinese and ASEAN officials said the decision by Chinese and 
ASEAN leaders to establish a free trade area is a ""historic 
milestone in economic co-operation between China and ASEAN"" and 
""demonstrates strong commitments by China-ASEAN leaders to 
regional integration and economic globalization as they pursue 
peace and stability and prosperity in the region."""
"Talks between China and the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN) about a free trade area went smoothly, senior 
officials said yesterday."
"But the official declined to disclose details about their 
two-day negotiations, saying these are just working level talks 
and more substantial progress will be made at the China and 
ASEAN economic ministers' meeting in September."
"A study by Chinese and ASEAN experts shows China's export to 
ASEAN will increase 55.1 per cent to US$10.6 billion and ASEAN's 
export to China will increase 48 per cent to US$13 billion after 
the establishment of the free trade area."
"The trade negotiation committee hosted its first meeting in 
Beijing in the last two days."
"Premier Zhu Rongji and ASEAN leaders agreed at the fifth 
China-ASEAN leaders' summit in November to set up a free trade 
area within 10 years."
"It 
will also take into account different levels of development 
between ASEAN countries and China."
"The third China-ASEAN Economic Senior Official's meeting, held 
in Beijing on Tuesday, set up a trade negotiation committee to 
hold in-depth discussions on the framework of a free trade area 
in the region."
"The framework will contain guidelines, principles, scope and 
modalities for establishing a free trade area, including early 
harvest, special and differential treatment and flexibility."
"""We are confident the framework will be ready for Chinese and 
ASEAN leaders to finalize at their November summit,"" said a 
senior official with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC)."
Two Japanese warships left for the Indian Ocean on Tuesday to replace vessels already there in support of US-led military operations in Afghanistan.
"TOKYO, Feb 17 (AFP) - Some 300 people demonstrated in Tokyo Sunday against US bases in Japan and the US military campaign in Afghanistan ahead of President George W. Bush's arrival for an official visit."
"US bases out now from Okinawa."""
"The Japanese parliament passed a law last October allowing its military to give medical and logistical support to US forces in any action against Taliban-ruled Afghanistan but only in ""non-combat zones."""
"""We firmly oppose Bush's war expansion policy,"" said Kenju Watanabe, an official of Japan-South Korea People Solidarity, a Tokyo-based citizens' group at the rally."
"No one was arrested, police said."
"""We are also against Japan's cooperation with the United States over any military action,"" Watanabe said."
"The Japanese southern island hosts 25,000 of the 51,000 US troops stationed in Japan."
"The peaceful protest was held at Ebisu park some four kilometers (2.5 miles) west of the US embassy, where the US president is to stay until Tuesday."
Another rally was held near the US embassy by some 50 members of environmental non-governmental organizations against a US alternative to the Kyoto climate change treaty.
It was the first time since World War II that parliament had passed legislation allowing Japanese troops to support US military action outside Japan and surrounding areas.
"Protesters carried banners reading ""Ratify the Kyoto Protocol"" and ""Koizumi say 'No' to Bush: Stick to Kyoto Protocol."""
"Demonstrators carried banners which read, ""US must stop war."
"The government plans to deploy some 18,000 police to boost security during Bush's first visit to Japan as president."
"On Thursday, Bush unveiled an alternative to the treaty he spurned last year, but some environmentalists claim that the proposal only benefits corporate America."
"Washington announced in April 2001 the most comprehensive arms package to Taipei since 1992, including four Kidd-class destroyers, eight diesel submarines and 12 P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft."
"Clinton said he did not support independence for Taiwan, the policy of ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan"" and agreed that Taiwan should not be a member of any organisation to which statehood is a requirement."
Compounding fears is speculation that Bush may sign a fresh communique with China in return for Beijing's support on issues such as anti-terrorism and prevention of nuclear proliferation.
"The first was issued during then-president Richard Nixon's landmark trip to China in 1972 while another one, signed during the Ronald Reagan era, agreed to gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan."
"Wu said he believed overall Taiwan interests were protected from knocks by the Bush administration because the island enjoyed ""strong support"" among decision-makers in the White House, the State Department and the Department of Defense."
"""Such a mindset will impair the healthy interaction between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China."""
The president has called for a peaceful resolution of the sovereignty dispute between Taipei and Beijing which split at the end of a civil war in 1949.
"Washington had guaranteed Taipei that it would not dilute its backing for the island in return for better relations with Beijing, Taiwan's foreign ministry spokeswoman Chang Siao-yueh told AFP."
Taiwanese officials are nonetheless concerned.
"Taipei was angered when then-president Bill Clinton pledged the ""three nos"" during his China visit in 1998."
The two countries have sealed three joint communiques since the end of the 1970s.
"""Through some proper channels, we have been told that there should not be surprises"" during Bush's visit to China, she said."
"Wu defended Taipei's cautious approach, warning that Beijing could try to use the situation to gain the upper hand."
"The sale infuriated Beijing which regards Taiwan an integral part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary."
"""He made it clear that relations between Taipei and Washington are getting better,"" said Joseph Wu, deputy director of National Chengchi University's Institute of International Relations."
"""Taiwan's interest would be harmed if the Chinese leaders took advantage of the occasion by making remarks unfavorable to Taipei and Washington failed to defend Taipei,"" Wu warned."
"In a speech through videoconference to hundreds of Taiwanese and Taiwanese American students from Harvard, Yale, Columbia and other US universities, Taiwan's Vice President Annette Lu on Saturday warned of Beijing's attempt to obstruct cross-strait ties."
"""As usual, Beijing will try its best to persuade President Bush into saying something disadvantageous to Taiwan,"" she said ahead of Bush's Asian trip."
"The US president embarked on a week-long tour of Asia late Saturday with stopovers in Japan, South Korea and China."
He will meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin on February 21 and 22.
Richard Bush is chairman and managing director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) -- a body authorised by Washington to handle exchanges since it switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.
"TAIPEI, Feb 17 (AFP) - Taiwan is keeping a wary eye on US President George W. Bush's China visit despite assurances by Washington that Taipei's interests would not be traded away during the trip."
"Before leaving for Asia, Bush said he would discuss with Beijing trade issues arising from China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, the global war on terror and the fate of Taiwan."
"Taiwan's foreign ministry has set up an ad hoc group to monitor Bush's Asia trip around-the-clock and report to President Chen Shui-bian, Chang said, adding Taipei's de facto embassy in Washington had a similar task."
"The top US official handling Taiwan affairs, Richard Bush -- no relation of the president -- also sought to ease Taipei's concerns during a visit to the island last month."
"Washington announced in April 2001 the most comprehensive arms package to Taipei since 1992, including four Kidd-class destroyers, eight diesel submarines and 12 P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft."
Compounding fears is speculation that Bush may sign a fresh communique with China in return for Beijing's support on issues such as anti-terrorism and prevention of nuclear proliferation.
"Washington had guaranteed Taipei that it would not dilute its backing for the island in return for better relations with Beijing, Taiwan's foreign ministry spokeswoman Chang Siao-yueh told AFP."
"""Through some proper channels, we have been told that there should not be surprises"" during Bush's visit to China, she said."
Richard Bush is chairman and managing director of the Washington-based American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) -- a body authorised by Washington to handle exchanges with Taipei since it switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.
"""Taiwan's interest would be harmed if the Chinese leaders took advantage of the occasion by making remarks unfavorable to Taipei and Washington failed to defend Taipei,"" Wu warned."
"""He made it clear that relations between Taipei and Washington are getting better,"" said Joseph Wu, deputy director of National Chengchi University's Institute of International Relations."
The two countries have sealed three joint communiques since the end of the 1970s.
"The sale infuriated Beijing which regards Taiwan an integral part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary."
Wu defended the government's cautious approach warning that Beijing could try to use the situation to gain the upper hand.
The president has called for a peaceful resolution of the lingering sovereignty dispute between Taipei and Beijing which split at the end of a civil war in 1949.
"The first was issued during then-president Richard Nixon's landmark trip to China in 1972 while another one, signed during the Ronald Reagan era, agreed to gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan."
"The US president embarked on a week-long tour of Asia late Saturday with stopovers planned in Japan, South Korea and China."
"The foreign ministry has set up an ad hoc group which will monitor Bush's Asian trip around-the-clock and report back to President Chen Shui-bian, Chang said, adding that Taiwan's de facto embassy in Washington had been given a similar task."
President Bush will hold a working summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing on February 21-22.
"Clinton said he did not support independence for Taiwan, the policy of ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan"" and agreed that Taiwan should not be a member of any organisation to which statehood is a requirement."
But Taiwanese officials are nonetheless concerned.
"The top US official handling Taiwan affairs, Richard Bush -- no relation of the president -- also moved to ease Taipei's concerns during his visit to the island last month."
"Wu said he believed overall Taiwan interests were protected from knocks by the Bush administration because of the island's ""strong support"" from decision-makers in the White House, State Department and Department of Defense."
"On the eve of his departure for Asia, Bush said he would discuss with Beijing trade issues arising from China's entry into the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the global war on terrorism and the fate of Taiwan."
"Taipei was angered when then-president Bill Clinton pledged the ""three nos"" during his China visit in 1998."
"TAIPEI, Feb 17 (AFP) - Taiwan is keeping a wary eye on US President George W. Bush's China visit despite assurances by Washington that Taipei's interests would not be traded away during the trip."
One cannot assume that Israel will act under the pressure of deeds and oversights that are often tainted with a significant degree of hypocrisy.
"In addition, the Parliament called for imposing a weapons embargo on Israel and the Palestinian Authority."
A unilateral move is likely to prejudice Europe's status in helping to find a solution to the conflict.
"European Commission President Romano Prodi expressed similar sentiments: in his opinion, the EU should consider imposing an economic ""punishment"" on Israel in protest against the operations of the Israel Defense Forces in the territories."
"Earlier this week, Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel, who does not miss an opportunity to provoke Israel, threatened that the EU would once again reconsider its relations with Jerusalem."
"However, the fact that certain countries have a more balanced view of the conflict is not the only reason to doubt that anti-Israeli decisions will, in fact, be adopted."
"It takes more than a recommendation from the European Parliament for this to happen; the decision has to be taken by both the European Commission and the EU's Council of Foreign Ministers, on which all 15 foreign ministers sit, and has to be unanimous."
"For some time, European politicians have threatened to suspend economic ties with Israel -- a move, which in light of close and extensive trade relations between EU member states and Israel, could cause serious damage."
"Israel will not change its positions on vital security issues, even if the European states eliminate customs breaks afforded to Israeli exports."
"Countries like France and Belgium are easily capable of voting for sanctions against Israel, but other states -- including Germany and Britain -- have exhibited a more balanced position regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
If the Europeans wish to influence Israel in the political arena -- in a direction that many in Israel would support wholeheartedly -- they will not be able to promote their positions in such a manner.
EU External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten expressed this clearly Tuesday when he said that canceling the association agreements between Israel and the EU would do nothing to enhance Jerusalem's readiness to listen to European representatives.
"The same goes for Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Pique, who was offended after Israel refused to allow him and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana to meet with PA Chairman Yasser Arafat in Ramallah."
What holds true with regard to threats by EU leaders also holds true for threats expressed by certain European states and the means of punishment they might already be implementing.
"The Europeans know that repeated denunciations of Israel, not to mention its punishment, will not lead to a solution of the conflict."
"The European Parliament, which convened yesterday in Strasbourg, decided to advise the 15 member states of the European Union to impose economic sanctions on Israel and, specifically, to suspend association agreements with Jerusalem."
"Despite the Parliament's recommendation, the chances that the association agreements will be suspended are very slim."
"There have been reports that vital components German factories are supposed to supply to the defense establishment are arriving slowly, as is the case regarding the arrival of vital supplies from other European countries."
"The source, interviewed by Interfax in Grozny, expressed confidence that that the command of the Russian forces in Chechnya would soon ""be able to obtain documentary confirmation"" that Khattab was dead."
"Official FSB sources in Moscow, when asked by Interfax, declined to make any comments."
Nor has Interfax been able to obtain confirmation from any other source.
"Repeated reports last year and this year said Khattab had been killed, but none of them has been confirmed by documentation."
"The source, who had taken part in the operation, did not disclose its dates."
"""An agent from among the Arabs who are fighting in Chechnya had earlier been recruited by the special services of one of the states in the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States] and was involved in the operation to liquidate Khattab,"" he said."
"Reports by our informers also confirm the likelihood of his death,"" the source said."
"GROZNY/MOSCOW. April 11 (Interfax) - A source in Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Thursday that it could be stated ""with a large degree of confidence"" that Jordanian-born Chechen rebel warlord Khattab was killed in a Russian ""intelligence and combat operation."""
"""One can say this with a large degree of confidence as, in the past two months, Khattab has not made his presence obvious in any way - he hasn't been on air, and actions by militants in the region controlled by Khattab are uncoordinated too."
The Palestinians also reported that the IDF has entered the village of Ubaydiyah east of Bethlehem and is conducting searches and arrests there.
Two IDF soldiers were lightly wounded in gunfire exchanges near the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.
They were evacuated to Jerusalem's Hadassah-En Kerem Hospital.
Sources in Bethlehem reported that the IDF has occupied the Palace Hotel at the outskirts of the Church of the Nativity compound.
State Minister Dervis will deliver a speech at the conference.
We will have low inflation and a stable economy as of 2003-2004.``
We should act carefully.
Now they are not.
"Dervis who touched on the cooperation between Turkey and Greece, said, ``the cooperation between Turkey and Greece also have great importance symbolically."
Dervis said that the power of the globalization were stronger than the effects of regionalization.
"Dervis who arrived in Salonica on Sunday attended the opening of the conference entitled, ``Black Sea Business Day`` which was organized by Black Sea Commerce and Development Bank."
We envisage a 3 percent growth in 2002.
"Dervis who defined the BSEC bank as an interesting idea, said that he believed that if that bank developed within a few years and entered the international markets, the bank would contribute to the improvement of the region in following years."
He is also scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with Greek Development Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos.
"After his meeting with Greek businessmen, Dervis will come together with Greek Minister Yeoryios Paskhalidhis for Macedonia and Thrace on Monday."
I call it as formation of good economic neighborhood.
"Speaking at the opening of the conference, Dervis defined the regional cooperation as formation of good neighborly field and said, ``the success of Western Europe after World War II laid in its creation of the good neighborly field."
We also plan to decrease inflation from 70 percent to 35 percent.``
"Recalling that the new tender law had enabled everyone to join public investment tenders, Dervis said that Greek investors could benefit from the law."
State Minister Dervis held a press conference at the Turkish Consulate General in Salonica after his arrival.
"For instance, tourism will become the most rapidly developing field for the next two decades."
State Minister Kemal Dervis has said that regional cooperation structures like the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) were not the antithesis of globalization.
"Noting that financial crisis came to an end in Turkey, Dervis said, ``financial crisis and panic ended."
Turkey and Greece have the opportunity of cooperating in tourism.``
Dervis came together with Greek Development Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos following the opening of the ceremony.
"However, it could be better."
A total of 21 laws prepared.
"He said, ``unfortunately, crises followed those rapid growth periods lasting for 3-4 years."
We have made many reforms in last period.
We do not know how Europe will develop towards southeast and east 15 or 20 years later.``
But around 4.5 percent growth was caught.
It is impossible not to wonder at the creators of the EU.
"SALONICA (A.A) - 15.04.2002 - State Minister Kemal Dervis for Economy arrived in Salonica city of Greece on Sunday to attend a conference to be organized by the Black Sea Commerce and Development Bank, and to hold a series of contacts with Greek officials."
There were earlier iron curtain countries and their borders were definite.
"For example, South America is not a good neighborly field, and therefore, all regional countries are suffering from difficulties.``"
"Speaking at the press conference, Dervis said, ``economic cooperation between Turkey and Greece will make an important contribution to the Balkans, Middle East and the Black Sea regions."
Turkey and Greece can cooperate in many fields like they have been doing so within structure of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC).
"Dervis said that regional countries` making investment in any sector was not a loss for the other regional countries, but was a benefit, and stated that the investors who got used to the region would also come to the other countries and this was effective especially in tourism sector."
This will show that they can convey the message of peace to the third countries.``
Dervis will depart from Greece later in the day after paying a visit to Salonica Mayor Vasilis Papayorgopoulos.
"Dervis went on saying, ``for example, the European Union (EU) is a story of success."
"However, I do not mean that we overcame all problems."
"Dervis stated that Turkey had shown a great economic performance in last 20-25 years, and added that Turkish economy grew by 7-8 percent."
I hoped that Turkish and Greek foreign ministers will visit Middle East jointly.
Europe should not be considered as a block which has the definite borders.
"This possibility and the proliferation of expressions of support for the overthrown leader among the military officers made a change of course advisable, with the forced resignation of Carmona and the even more meteoric period in office of Chavez's vice-president, Diosdado Cabello, who only took up the post in order to give his leader time to reappear."
But the latest events reveal that his popularity had not collapsed.
"All of this leaves in the air a feeling of military uncertainty, after a two-way trip in 24 hours which will undoubtedly leave deep wounds in armed forces which clearly have not given up their wish to exert a decisive influence in political life."
"It may or may not be to the liking of the Western foreign ministries which shared to some extent Washington's pleasure at the ousting of Hugo Chavez, but the course of events in Venezuela has shown that he has the support of the majority of the population, who want him in the presidency, from which he was deposed and in which he was reinstalled by the military in a confused uprising..."
"But President Chavez too is seriously damaged by his links to the groups of armed followers who left a score of dead in Thursday's !
[1!
1 April] crushing of the demonstrations."
"Military threat persists after events in Venezuela, Spanish daily says"
"The civilian opposition, which in the absence of political parties was organized around the employers' organization and the trade unions, does not come out of it well either."
"Debatable decisions of his have caused a deep social polarization and brought him into confrontation with representative sectors of civil society, against which he used more demagogy than arguments."
"All of which, incidentally, is something of which Chavez has done very little so far."
"Criticisms of Chavez's governance have been widespread in the democratic world, above all in the past year, in which he has taken to visiting dictators like Castro or Saddam Husayn and writing to terrorists like the famous Carlos, instead of meeting his promises of prosperity and fair shares."
The coup misjudged its strength and Carmona remaining in power could have led to a serious division of the armed forces.
"It is time for the former officer to rethink, to set priorities, to understand that the Cuban model no longer works even for Havana, to give up, as he has promised, revanchism and to understand that Venezuela is a Western country where there is no reason for it to be impossible to improve the fate of the Venezuelans and eradicate the eternal scourge of corruption, within a framework comparable to that of the rest of the world."
The today revived president will have to tackle the future with different methods.
"""We appreciate the return to stability of Venezuela's domestic situation,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said."
"BEIJING, April 16 (AFP) -- China Tuesday welcomed Venezuela's return to political stability and expressed support for President Hugo Chavez's promise for a dialogue on national reconciliation following his return to power after a coup."
"As a friend of Venezuela, China hoped to further strengthen friendship and cooperation with the country, Zhang said."
"""We believe that under the leadership of President Chavez, the people of Venezuela will devote themselves to political stability and economic development and make more progress in social advancement."""
"Chavez, who returned to power Sunday, promised Monday to invite a broad spectrum of Venezuelan society to participate in a dialogue on the country's problems."
"Having regard to the fact that 95.1 percent of foreign immigrants were coming from African and Middle Eastern countries, it becomes more difficult to prevent illegal migration from under developed countries to European countries via Turkey,`` it added."
"``Most of the illegal migration incidents by sea happened in western provinces of Izmir, Aydin and Mugla."
Turkish citizens from southern and southeastern provinces accounted for 31 percent.
These incidents generally increase in spring and fall.
"2,816 of these foreigners were captured in the first 11 months of 2001."
"The decree said that human smuggling incidents from the Turkish coasts to Greek islands, Italy and France increased recently due to economic, social and political reasons."
"According to the report, Turkish and Greek flagged ships, fishing boats and speed boats were used by human smugglers."
Iraqi and Afghan immigrants followed them.
"ANKARA, Dec 15 (A.A) - Interior Minister Rustu Kazim Yucelen released a decree on Saturday, and announced measures to be taken against illegal migration by sea."
28 out of 63 incidents were reported in Bodrum township of Mugla.
"It said that the Coast Guard units had intercepted a total of 6 thousand 743 foreigners since January 1, 1996."
"The Coast Guard Command has been working on a report to give detailed information about its activities against human smuggling and number of foreigners intercepted between January 1 and November 26, 2001."
"It does not matter where in the world, he will vigorously hunt terrorists down if they are perceived to seek to target the United States."
He simply condenses his foreign policy for others to easily understand by distinguishing the evil from the good.
"As reminder, former US President Ronald Reagan used to call the Soviet Union ""the Evil Empire."""
"In the presidential election, he campaigned on economic and education issues and barely scraped through."
But the unexpected happened and what followed -- Usama Bin Ladin and the war in Afghanistan -- have elevated foreign policy to become the central part of his administration.
The line that Bush draws between friends and foes has never been any clearer.
The circumstance has led Bush to again adopt an aggressive policy.
"It is necessary for Thai people to understand the important change in the policy of the country whose economic, political, and military influence impact on the world the most."
"For example, some 660 US soldiers have been dispatched to the Philippines to join Filipino soldiers to suppress the Abu Sayyaf."
Bush's objective is clear.
"Basically, he is telling the world the enemies of America is not just al-Qa'ida or Usama Bin Ladin."
The events on 11 September forced Bush to overhaul the US foreign policy.
"Although the US role is identified as participation in military exercise or as adviser, the real purpose is the soldiers are sent there to participate in missions that the targets are the groups that are regarded as enemies of the United States."
Foreign policy was an issue that he never wanted to deal with before.
"Iran tried to become more helpful to the United States during the war in Afghanistan, but now that it has been identified as an ""evil"" it likely will readjust its stance."
The countries that possess the lethal weapons are the targets of suppression by the United States.
This may result in more intense armed confrontation.
The terrorist groups may step up sabotage of US targets and the US allies.
"It is not enough that he sees those countries as evil, he wants his allies to feel the same way about them as well."
A close look will show that the United States has already carried out this aggressive policy in abrupt and rapid manner without comprehensively consulting with the countries concerned.
Many believed that Bush was naive about foreign affairs.
"The term ""Axis of Evil"" that President George W. Bush used to label Iraq, Iran, and North Korea has now become a hot, much-discussed phrase."
"Bush deliberate used the term to emphasize to the world the adversarial US position toward the three countries that, according to Washington's claim, still assist terrorists and seek to develop lethal weapons."
"The US naming of North Korea may annoy China, given its assistance to the United States in the war in Afghanistan."
"Whether a country agrees with and regardless of how it views the US policy, the United States is taking the direction that emphasizes its national security and confrontation with the countries that Washington regards as enemies."
He claims that he belongs to the good side and whoever is on the other side is the evil that must be destroyed or at least deserves condemnation.
The world has heated up a notch.
The new US policy deserves to be closely analyzed and monitored.
"For the countries that regard the three countries as friends or not evil, they are considered to be enemies of the United States."
He has declared that the war against terrorism will not end at Afghanistan but will spread to other parts of the world.
"As Bush has declared that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea are the ""Axis of Evil,"" it emphatically implies that he regards it as duty to stop them from manufacturing or acquiring lethal weapons, be they chemical, biological, or nuclear."
"The word ""axis"" reminds me of the grouping of countries during World War I and II that were enemies of the Allies."
"No one was injured, and the fighting stopped when local authorities intervened, Jan told AFP."
"""It was a minor clash, but investigations are continuing."
"Dostam's fighters and ethnic Tajiks loyal to former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani previously battled in Kunduz province, east of Mazar-i-Sharif, leaving 11 dead."
"It was the second reported clash in a fortnight involving the forces of Dostam, the interim government's deputy defence minister, and Tajik fighters."
Dostam and Rabbani's factions are seen as uneasy partners in the fragile Northern Alliance that fought the Taliban militia from 1996 until the hardline Islamic regime crumbled in the face of US bombing in November.
Jan called the fighting between local commanders a symptom of the 23 years of war that has devastated Afghanistan.
"Most of them occur usually for personal interests,"" he said."
"""These battles have always happened in our country."
"We will identify the culprits of these clashes and punish them,"" he said."
"There was a ""one to two hour"" battle Saturday between forces loyal to Uzbek warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostam and those of rival Tajik commander Atta Mohammad, defence ministry official Mira Jan said."
"KABUL, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Fresh fighting has broken out between rival warlords in the northern Afghanistan city of Mazar-i-Sharif, a defence ministry official said Sunday."
The factional infighting has raised fears that long-standing ethnic rivalries could again split the country after the defeat of the Taliban.
"After he set forth the ""Axis of Evil"" theory in his State of the Union speech, Bush met with increasing attacks from the international community."
Albright particularly noted that she had contacted and reached agreement with the DPRK.
"An US government official said that US diplomats to countries concerned are authorized to explain to these countries which may have doubts about Bush's State of the Union speech, this is aimed at dispelling various countries' doubt that the United States is about to dispatch troops to Iran, Iraq and Korea."
"She said that the principle Bush currently uses in handling foreign affairs has caused the international community to think that the United States is doing things ""in an utterly disorderly way"" and has ""lost reason""."
"Iran also indicated that in case US pilots were hit in Afghanistan and landed in Iran, Iran would give them assistance."
Chirac's assistant indicated that the good-and-evil view does not conform to the actual conditions in the present-day world.
"Carpenter, deputy director of the US non-governmental research organization the Cato Institute, holds that Bush's criticism of Korea by name is really hard to understand."
"The three countries have reacted strongly, condemned and counter-attacked Bush, and this is only natural and rational."
"An analytical article carried in the Washington Post says that including Iran on the ""Axis of Evil"" list is all the more astonishing."
The analyst was worried that Bush's attack on Iran would possibly forfeit all recent efforts.
"Straw added that Britain and the United States had become the closest allies after the ""September 11"" incident, now they may no longer stand shoulder to shoulder."
"At the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum held in New York, NATO Secretary General George Robertson said that in charging Korea, Iran and Iraq with so-called ""Axis of Evil"", the United States must produce evidence."
"The deputy director said, ""It's really strange for Bush to include Korea on the list of these countries, because in recent years Korea has not actively supported terrorist activities."
"Secretary of State Colin Powell admonishes his subordinates that when the mass media discuss the matter, the spirit and literal meaning of Bush's speech must be strictly acted upon to avoid causing doubts in the external world."
Observers in Washington maintain that the NATO Secretary-general's statement indicates that the international community feels uneasy about the Bush administration's policy which seems to be determined to expand the scope of the anti-terror war.
"She said that on the Afghanistan issue and some other questions, the United States still needs the aid of Iran."
Even US closest allies also thought it hard to agree with Bush's remark.
"Carpenter also said that in this way, the door to improving relations with Iran would be completely blocked."
"On 1 February, when interviewed by the American Broadcasting Corporation, Madeleine Albright, former US Secretary of State, described Bush's ""Axis of Evil"" remark as ""a gross mistake""."
"Some senior US government officials and experts and the Western allies of the United States have criticized Bush's speech, saying that the ""Axis of Evil"" is, more or less, untenable."
"US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said: ""We will send all relevant information and summaries of this information to our embassies in various places around the world to facilitate understanding of the related arguments."""
"Whereas Bush has ""single-handedly destroyed"" the initial relationship she had established with Korea during the Clinton age."
"He added that that would be the most unfortunate part of Bush's speech, he cast away the chance for improving relations with Iran."
"A report carried in British Daily Telegraph on 2 February said that British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw queried the ""Axis of Evil"" theory set forth in Bush's State of the Union speech, thinking that such a remark of Bush attempts to use the anti-terror war to play with political party politics."
Albright also pointed out that the situation in Iran at the present stage is very complicated.
"The French presidential office does not make open comments on Bush's statement, it only says that what Bush says is directed mainly to the Americans."
Now President Bush has completely closed the door to improvement of ties with Iran.
"When George W. Bush was delivering the State of the Union Speech to both Senate and the House of Representatives of US Congress on 29 January, with unprecedented wordings he lashed out at DPRK (the Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Iran and Iraq, labeling the three countries as the ""Axis of Evil""."
White House and State Department Hasten to Smooth the Matter Over
The article says that the United States tried hard to establish a new relationship with Iran last fall and expressed its appreciation for Iran's condemnation of terrorism.
"She said: ""putting the three countries together is a gross mistake."" She is particularly opposed to listing the DPRK in the so-called Axis of Evil, saying that Bush's way of doing things will possibly cause the United States to lose popular support among the international community."
"Furthermore, ""according to evidence in our hands,"" he added, ""Korea's nuclear project has all along been frozen since the mid-1990s."
"The State Department said on 1 February that they would collect various statements and send them to US embassies in various countries worldwide, so as to calm down foreign countries' negative reactions to Bush's speech."
"In a bid to alleviate the sentiments of US allies, a White House official has discretely assured US allies that Bush does not hint to take military actions."
"I don't know why Bush listed Korea as one among the terrorist countries."""
"Some commentaries said that including Korea on the ""Axis of Evil"" list would irritate Korea and would cause Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK) feel disturbed."
Difficult for Britain and France To Agree with US
"French President Jacques Chirac does not subscribe to the ""Axis of Evil"" theory advanced by US President Bush."
Albright: First to Launch Attack
He will become one of the best elements in the corps of European astronauts.
"People there are really unanimous about him,"" she told us."
"About 10 years ago, Dirk Frimout was the first Belgian astronaut to go into earth orbit."
An example?
"The latest, and also undoubtedly the most logical, is internal to the SSTC, the federal Scientific, Technical, and Cultural Services, which, in particular, manage the country's space budgets."
"""Budgets will remain constant,"" explained Eric Beka, the SSTC's secretary general."
On it Frank De Winne will serve as the on-board engineer.
The sums obtained will result from the assignment of a portion of the space budget to this mission (and its many related scientific fall-outs) rather than to other optional programs.
"This is a first on a ""TMA,"" which attests to the confidence the Russian and European partners have put in him."
"So, if that should prove necessary, De Winne will be able to personally pilot the space ship."
Cancellation Insurance
"""This should insure that we can recover the sums involved, that in the prospect of another space trip."" One million euros will be devoted to this ""cancellation"" insurance."
An initial segment of 2.5 million euros (Frank's training costs) will reportedly be paid in the next few days.
"So he will be the second most qualified crew member on board, behind the on-board comander, who still needs to be appointed by the Russian space authorities."
"On Thursday [29 November] the Belgian Government formally committed itself, vis-a-vis its Russian and European partners (the European Space Agency [ESA]), to pay Frank De Winne's ticket into space."
"In addition, he will carry the projects of Belgian scientists and industrialists active in the space sector far."
In a few weeks the second Belgian to go up there will don a Russian cosmonaut's space suit.
It will be a mission that will be rich in promises.
His dynamism is an asset.
"The highway to the stars is looking radiant for the Belgian ""cosmonaut."""
The sum in question will come from the SSTC's space budgets and be deducted in several years (two or three).
"For 10 days, the second Belgian astronaut will get to the International Space Station [ISS] on board the brand new Russian Soyuz TMA-1 space ship."
"So on 4 November 2002, that is to say, in a little less than one year, the second Belgian to reach space will take off from the Baikonor cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on board a brand new Soyuz space ship: the TMA-1."
Nor will the space sector's in particular.
"In several weeks, he learned the indispensable bases of the Russian language."
"The formal agreement regarding Frank De Winne's flight with the Russians was signed in Brussels on Thursday by Charles Picque, the Minister for Science Policy, and his government commissioner Yvan Ylieff."
"As Picque emphasized, ""for many years, each franc invested by Belgium in space has brought in three francs."""
"""This assessment confirms us in our choices,"" a delighted Ylieff said."
"The document, a letter sent to both the ESA (European Space Agency, to which Frank De Winne currently reports) and the Russian Rosaviacosmos space agency, guaranteed the payment by Belgium of the expenses tied to this space trip."
"""Since there is no other Belgian astronaut at the ESA who is capable of replacing Frank De Winne for this mission if it suddenly proved impossible for him to carry it out, we are also expecting to take out 'travel insurance' for our 'cosmonaut,'"" Yvan Ylieff also said."
It is a ship that is more modern and bigger than the current Soyuzes.
This is an amount that Belgian yesterday pledged to pay to Russia.
De Winne will thus qualify technically in space piloting.
Some Particularly Financial Choices
This appointment is not expected for a few weeks.
"And his ""parachute"" too."
Who said that space investments were not interesting?
"In a word, De Winne's ticket into space has been financed."
"In Brussels on Wednesday [28 November], the French astronaut Claudie Haignere, who had just completed a flight in space together with the Russians that in every way was identical to the one scheduled for De Winne, could not find enough praise for our fellow citizen, with whom she trained for several months in Moscow."
Several avenues have been explored to collect the overall amount.
"""Frank worked at Star City with much intensity."
"As is known, Frank De Winne's taxi flight lasting about 10 days comes with a price tax: some 600 million [Belgian] francs (15.5 million euros)."
The SSTC's overall budget will not suffer from this.
That was with the US Atlantis shuttle.
He is making appreciable efforts to meet the other foreign cosmonauts who are in training there and share his experiences.
"As such they face the prospect of being subjected to the due course of law and in the final analysis perhaps sentenced to death in closed military courts instead of in open courts, as is the right of prisoners of war under the terms of the Geneva Convention."
"And for this reason, too, they have a moral duty to speak out, as Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh, among others, did yesterday."
"In an antiterrorist war that at the time was initially launched as Operation Infinite Justice, it is infinitely difficult to reconcile oneself to the pictures of chained and humiliated Taliban and al-Qaida prisoners at the U.S. Guantanamo base on Cuba."
"The pictures resemble an attempt to satisfy a primitive thirst for revenge and convince the Americans that the Bush administration has not only succeeded in removing a regime of religious madmen in out-of-the-way Afghanistan, but also in taking prisoner some of those responsible for the terrorist acts on that day in September."
"With its behavior, therefore, the United States is not only compromising the image of the war against terrorism as an expression of a higher form of justice, but also of itself as an unshakeable defender of this same justice."
Many of them have already demonstrated great skill in their own behavior when it comes to exploiting the West's fear of terrorism.
"The U.S. and most recently the British governments reject the suggestion that the prisoners are being harmed, but this does not alter the fact that the pictures of hooded prisoners in chains are in themselves enough to paint a picture of a United States that in the name of self-righteousness - and equally worryingly: without any great amount of debate - has allowed itself to infringe international rules."
"This will undoubtedly rub off on the superpower's allies, including Denmark."
"Otherwise they face the risk not only of undermining the legitimacy of their own antiterrorism war at present, but also of sending out a signal that despots around the world will know how to exploit."
"For most people it will of course be difficult to mobilize any great degree of understanding for those responsible for the bloody terrorism in the United States on that day in September, but what is at issue here is that at the present moment principles are at stake that could have far-reaching repercussions for the future war against terrorism."
"Instead the superpower has entered a legal fog where the prisoners have been stamped with a nonsense term in international law: ""battlefield prisoners."""
This impression is reinforced by the fact that for the time being at least the United States has ignored the Geneva Convention and refused to treat those taken prisoner as prisoners of war - something to which they have a right - until a competent court has decided differently.
"""The prisoners must be treated with respect for their integrity and religion, and they must be given a fair trial,"" Fogh Rasmussen says."
The Danish People's Party sees no reason to criticize the United States.
"Otherwise it must be a matter between the United States and the countries which have citizens who are directly affected,"" Peter Skaarup said, alluding to the United Kingdom and Sweden."
"Even though we support their action, we should criticize this form of treatment of prisoners,"" Socialist People's Party Chairman Holger K. Nielsen said."
"""I do not have all the information, but there are some questionable aspects in the U.S. approach,"" political spokesman Mogens Lykketoft (Social Democratic Party) told Ritzau Bureau."
"The Socialist People's Party is sending an ""urgent call"" to the government to deliver official criticism to the United States."
"On Monday Liberal Party foreign affairs spokesman Troels Lund Poulsen said that the debate on prisoners' rights is ""an intellectual discussion."""
"""This could of course become necessary if a Dane were involved."
"""The U.S. Government has announced that the United States will respect its international commitments,"" Fogh Rasmussen said at his weekly press conference on Tuesday [22 January]."
The Swedish Government has also expressed concern about the prisoners' rights.
Fogh: They Must Be Given a Fair Trial
The Social Democratic Party takes the view that the Danish Government should raise its voice against the United States.
"""I expect the United States to satisfy the requirements of the international conventions,"" Per Stig Moller said at a press conference in Berlin on Monday."
"I can imagine that the United States has had good reasons for transporting them to Cuba,"" foreign affairs spokesman Peter Skaarup (Danish People's Party) says."
"As long as no Danes are involved, the Danish People's Party does not think that Denmark should interfere."
Danish People's Party: Are They Danes?
He will now ask the foreign minister to give a written reply outlining the government's position on the issue.
Criticism From the Red Cross
"We must focus on the treatment of them."""
He points out that the United States has allowed the Red Cross to inspect conditions at the Guantanamo base.
"He fails to mention, however, that on the international stage the Red Cross has subsequently criticized the U.S. treatment of prisoners."
"""To begin with, I have great confidence that what the Americans are doing in relation to these prisoners is reasonable."
Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen (Liberal Party) has voiced his approval of the U.S. treatment of the 144 al-Qaida prisoners at the U.S. Guantanamo military base on Cuba.
Per Stig Moller: Give Them Rights
""" Social Democratic Party: Raise Denmark's Voice"
Foreign Minister Per Stig Moller (Conservative People's Party) is urging the United States to guarantee the prisoners the status of prisoners of war and in consequence protection under the terms of the Geneva Convention.
"""It cannot be the duty of the Danish Government to applaud everything that the Americans do."
"EU foreign affairs spokesman Javier Solana, among others, has also criticized the United States for not recognizing the al-Qaida prisoners as prisoners of war as understood in the Geneva Convention."
"""Of course the United States has a point when it says that it can be difficult to decide who are terrorists and who are prisoners of war."
"In the countries in which torture is systematically carried out, for example Cuba or China, inspection by international organizations is not permitted."
"However, we may be witnessing a distortion of reality, and even in some cases pure falsehoods."
The result of the report will have to be taken into account before political and moral judgments of guilty or not guilty are made.
"If these accusations are confirmed, the only possible definition will be torture and the violation of human rights."
"The photos were sent voluntarily to the press by the American authorities, who clarified that they depicted a group of 20 dangerous prisoners who had recently arrived at the base and undergone a process of identification prior to their confinement."
Spanish daily urges caution in judging USA's treatment of suspects
But this enormous difference is not enough.
These were in no way their normal living conditions.
Nor does it seem proper to cite the fact that the base is not on American soil because it is a rented base.
It must be known as soon as possible whether or not terror has been established in Guantanamo.
"But the decisive fact is the presence for days of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is preparing a report and which, as usual, has refused to make any statements."
Indications exist that the system to which the prisoners are subjected is excessively harsh.
It is another matter to launch into scandal or anti-Americanism.
The United States government does not help dispel the suspicions when it refuses to consider them prisoners of war and therefore to apply the Geneva Convention to them.
"In any case, the attitude of the American authorities has nothing to do with the one previously and currently displayed by dictatorships and totalitarian systems, including communist ones, which permit neither inspection nor the dissemination of photographs."
"For the time being, the members of the British government who interviewed three prisoners of their nationality have received no complaints about the treatment they are receiving."
"Critics condemn the inhumane nature of the treatment the prisoners are receiving, handcuffed, immobilized with shackles, subjected to sensory deprivation and confined to minute cells."
"But for the time being, what exist are indications and shadows of suspicion which must materialize or be dispelled through knowledge of the facts from the relevant reports."
Herein lies the difference.
It will speak in its report.
"Backing from a majority of the public would not serve, either, as justification for the possible excesses and violations of rights."
The dissemination of some photos taken of a group of detainees in Guantanamo has aroused international controversy.
"Presumed war criminals such as Milosevic enjoy all the guarantees of a fair trial, but the Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters at Guantanamo will get a trial which falls far short of the basic standards of the US Constitution and the treaty on civil and political rights ratified by the United States."
The consequences of 11 September are also making themselves felt far from the battlefield.
"There is, in the first place, the case of the military action in Afghanistan."
"There is a great deal of truth in that, but in the light of what has happened afterwards, the question arises as to whether the Americans and their allies themselves are not sometimes inclined to sacrifice these values for the ""good cause."""
"It is all the more to be deplored that such statements come from somebody who, as a senior commander, serves as an example to others regarding the observance of rules of humanitarian law."
"According to witnesses, these were attacks in an area where neither al-Qa'ida troops nor Taliban had been observed."
"Through that, the United States can detain and try anybody who is not a US citizen and who is suspected of being a member of al-Qa'ida or of being involved in international terrorism in one way or another."
"There also seems to be a difference among the foreigners: In all likelihood, captured British fighters will be sent to Britain after questioning."
There is no doubt that a military operation and intensified security measures were imperative after the terrible tragedy of 11 September.
"Apart from the reasons or justification for such an action, all the combatants' war conduct must be constantly tested against the standards of international humanitarian law; that is, the rules which curb the use of force during a military operation."
"If it emerges that the person concerned cannot be removed from British territory because he is in serious danger in his own country, he can be detained almost indefinitely under this law."
"A number of other countries have sharpened their laws following 11 September, from increased detention possibilities to stricter legislation on asylum and immigration."
"Even if these attacks were directed against a clear military target, the large number of civilian casualties would still never be justifiable, because whoever plans a military attack must take all precautions to prevent such a tragedy."
Other states have used the US tragedy to polish their own image.
"The two supplementary protocols to the Geneva Conventions, adopted in 1977, increase, among other things, the protection of the civilian population."
"The need for timely and accurate information about possible new attacks is naturally particularly great, but whether the global ban on torture can be abused on that account is another matter."
"However, the ends -- dealing with those opponents -- does not justify all the means."
"Humanitarian law leaves no doubt that those who fall captive in their opponent's hands are entitled at all times to decent treatment, even if they do not qualify for prisoner of war status."
"Appeal is not possible, but the death penalty is."
That al-Qa'ida terrorists and Taliban fighters are not very concerned about the human suffering that they have caused is also generally known.
"Now, nearly two months later, concern about the fate of the captive Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters has further increased."
"Such a building enjoys the highest possible protection, and can and should never be the object of an attack, unless it is clearly established that it is being used for military purposes."
It is stated in black and white that it is hardly feasible for these commissions to apply the normal principles of law and rules of evidence.
"In the media, the possibility of questioning presumed terrorists very roughly is also being considered aloud."
"Newspaper headlines such as ""United Nations Confirms US Bombing of Village and Mosque"" and ""100 Killed in Bombing in Eastern Afghanistan"" speak for themselves."
"Hence you can hardly speak of a ""targeting error"" when a Red Cross warehouse, although clearly recognizable by the large red cross painted on the roof, was shelled twice by US aircraft."
"These rules, laid down in the four Geneva Conventions, provide, among other things, for the protection of sick and wounded servicemen and prisoners of war."
"Whenever there is a suspicion that a foreigner is involved in international terrorism, he will be arrested and imprisoned."
"Transporting these people, shackled hand and foot and with hoods over their heads, shaving their beards -- which form part of their religious identity -- and their ""accommodation"" in half-open and cages that are much too small can probably never pass this test..."
What raises even more questions is the order that President Bush issued last November.
"Under the protest of international and US human rights organizations but with the approval of large sections of the population, antiterrorism measures are being adopted in great haste."
"Shortly after its decision to take military action, the Bush administration also decided to provide the press with only sparse information about the course of the operation."
"Although it is doubtful that all the news reaches us from Afghanistan, a great many press reports suggest that humanitarian law was violated regularly over the past few weeks."
"The attacks on the World Trade Center Towers and the Pentagon were attacks on the freedoms and values for which the United States and the Western world stand, President Bush declared shortly afterward, and many people in Europe repeated it after him."
"Back in 1949, it was agreed by nearly all the states in the world that the sufferings of war must henceforth become more bearable, especially for those who are not directly involved in the conflict."
"In addition, attempts must be made to prevent any unnecessary suffering by both military personnel and civilians by, for instance, imposing restrictions on the use of weapons."
Because press freedom -- the jewel of the US Constitution -- can be restricted for reasons of national security.
Not only with the protection of the civilian population does something sometimes go wrong.
"Consequently, evidence will be accepted that ""a normal person"" deems to have the value of evidence."
"In December 2001, the UK proclaimed a state of emergency and passed the Antiterrorism, Crime, and Security Act."
Moving the captives to the Guantanamo Bay military base on Cuba is rightly whipping up a storm of protest.
Only special military commissions can try them.
"The fight against terrorism is undoubtedly justified, but, as with every struggle, it also holds true that the fundamental principles of human rights and humanitarian law must be respected."
That would amount to a flagrant violation of humanitarian law: whoever ceases fighting for whatever reason is entitled to protection.
Foreigners suspected of maintaining (loose) ties with terrorist organizations can be detained indefinitely.
"On the other hand, US Taliban or al-Qa'ida fighters, such as the recently captured John Walker Lindh, will be tried by ordinary US criminal courts."
"In other case, too, it seems doubtful that the crucial distinction between military and civilian targets was made systematically."
Not in the United States alone are the screws being tightened.
"Hence, humanitarian law requires that in all circumstances a distinction be made between military targets and those not involved in the armed conflict."
"But the greatest attention is paid to the fate of the civilian population: In principle, the latter can never be the object of a military operation."
"This has happened despite solemn pledges to the United Nations that the United States ""is committed to minimizing civilian casualties and damage to civilian property."""
"There is uncertainty about the precise number, but it is certain that over 1,000 men from the Middle East have already been arrested."
"Observance of these rules will not insure that the fight against terrorism is lost; it will prove respect for human dignity, of which the West is rightly a champion."
"Many countries are parties to them, but the United States has not ratified these protocols, so that the additional protection they offer is difficult to enforce in a conflict in which US troops are taking part."
"Out of well-understood self-interest, countries such as Russia, China, and Israel joined in the Bush administration's anti-terrorism campaign, because it enabled them to compare their domestic situation with the US situation and ask for moral support for the fight they have been waging against terrorism for years."
The right of citizens to such information about their government's actions is crippled by the fact that it is being accepted for the present without much complaint.
"Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called Palestinian leader Arafat ""Our Usama Bin Ladin."""
"Hence guilt need not be established ""beyond reasonable doubt,"" nor is there any mention of a presumption of innocence."
"Secretary Rumsfeld's statements (on 20 November 2001) that ""the United States is not inclined to negotiate surrenders, nor are we in a position, with relatively small numbers of forces on the ground, to accept prisoners,"" and that ""my hope is that they will be either killed or taken prisoner (by the Northern Alliance)"" also suggested that death would be the only way out of the conflict for the Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters."
"On the whole, according to the RSE, 343,735 tonnes of cargo were handled through Aktau seaport between 1 and 21 January."
Kazakhstan's main seaport does brisk business
"As Interfax-Kazakhstan news agency learnt at the RSE, a total of 79,000 tonnes of oil and oil products and 37,044 tonnes of dry cargo were transshipped through the port during the quoted period."
"A total of 261,841 tonnes of oil and oil products and 81,894 tonnes of dry cargo have been transshipped through the port since the start of January."
"Aktau, 22 January. The Aktau Sea Trading Port republican state enterprise (RSE) on the Caspian Sea (situated in Mangistau Region of western Kazakhstan) handled over 116,000 tonnes of cargo between 14 and 21 January [2002]."
Aktau seaport is Kazakhstan's only international seaport with annual transshipment capacity of 1.5m tonnes of dry cargo and 8m tonnes of oil and oil products.
"Israel says that it carried out this tactic in Bethlehem and Bayt Jala, or so it claims, and yesterday, it claimed that it carried out the same tactic in Qalqiliyah when the Palestinian security forces returned to the three centers that had been re-occupied by the invading Israeli forces."
"This being the case, it would be better for both Israel and the Palestinians to have an immediate and parallel Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied parts of several Palestinian cities."
The inevitable result of this tactic -- if it succeeds in temporarily calming down the situation -- is that it will take back conditions to their former state of tension after the withdrawals are completed from all the Palestinian cities.
Such a political framework would lay the firm foundations for a comprehensive peace based on justice and recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people.
It does not leave any city or town except after reaching what it calls a security agreement with the Palestinian side for a cease-fire in that particular city or town.
It is not implementing an immediate and total withdrawal -- as demanded by the international community as a whole and the United States in particular -- but a phased and partial withdrawal.
Only such a peace can bring security and stability to all the parties without exception.
The core of the matter lies in a just and acceptable political framework that Israel is supposed to approve and participate in to put a final end to the occupation and to the settlement construction activities.
"These days, the Israeli government is adopting a relatively new tactic regarding its plan to withdraw from the Palestinian cities and towns that it had re-occupied more than three weeks ago."
"Talking about it and about its possible use are several months old and, more exactly, they have been going on since the Israeli Government headed by Ari'el Sharon came to power about nine months ago."
"This tactic is no more than an improved carbon copy of the style of ""divide and rule."""
The facts show that this Israeli tactic is new only in execution.
"Only such an immediate and parallel withdrawal would expedite the return to serious negotiations between the two sides based on the reference point of ending the occupation, ending settlement construction activities, and restoring the full inalienable rights of the Palestinian people."
"The Israeli Government hopes that this tactic would eventually lead to an integrated and total agreement when all its parts are put together to form a map of ""cantons"" that Israel envisions for the occupied Palestinian lands."
The Israeli press and other media outlets point out that future withdrawals from the cities parts of which are still under Israeli occupation will be carried out in accordance to this tactic of phased and partial withdrawal.
The core of the matter is not in the method that Israel is using to crush the Palestinian moves and confiscate the will of the Palestinian people for liberation and independence.
Israel seems to think that this tactic will circumvent the Palestinian move toward independence and will put an end to the Palestinian intifadah by surrounding the areas of tension and dealing with them separately.
It actually reflects Israel's determination not to deal with the Palestinian issue as one united and indivisible whole.
"On 26 November, a Progress M1-7 transport spaceship should be launched from Baykonur to the International Space Station."
"Autonomous tests of a booster are under way at an assembly and testing hangar at Baykonur, and the spacecraft is simultaneously being loaded with fuel components, the press service of the Russian Space Forces reported."
The first one took place on 21 May of this year.
Its launch will be carried out by a modernized Soyuz-FG booster designed and manufactured at the Progress aerospace centre in Samara.
"The engines of the rocket's second and third stages have been modernized, and this will be the second launch of the modernized booster carried out by the Russian Aerospace Agency, Rosaviakosmos."
"At the present time, units of the Russian Space Forces at Baykonur have begun preparations for the sixth launch of a Proton-K booster this year."
The rocket will put a Meteor-3M hydrometeorological spacecraft into orbit.
The Proton to be launched on 23 November will put a satellite into orbit for the Russian Defence Ministry's needs.
"Moscow, 6 November: Three spacecraft will be launched from the Baykonur space centre in November."
The launch of a Zenit-2 booster produced by the Dnipropetrovsk Yuzhmash enterprise is preliminarily scheduled for 30 November.
"The rest of the city was reported to be calm however, with some schools reopening and authorities anxiously awaiting the arrival of a mediation team from the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)."
"On Monday, 80 Libyan soldiers disembarked from an Antonov transport plane carrying military equipment, an African diplomat said."
"On Tuesday, Bozize was still holed up in his Bangui residence."
"Libyan forces helped prop up Patasse at the time, and 100 soldiers have since remained in his presidential guard."
Defense and security ministers were dismissed in August.
Bozize was fired last month as part of moves by Bangui to close security loopholes which became evident after the abortive putsch.
"The country has been on edge since last May when mutinous soldiers attempted to overthrow Patasse, unleashing 10 days of fighting in the capital that left dozens of people dead and displaced thousands."
"The shooting began after soldiers tried to arrest Bozize, a former close ally of Patasse who had been army chief since 1996, in connection with large amounts of weapons discovered in the city, amid suspicions of an attack in preparation."
"BANGUI, Nov 6 (AFP) - Gunfire broke out for a fifth day Tuesday in the capital of the Central African Republic, after Libyan military reinforcements were flown in to help government forces end a standoff by soldiers loyal to an ousted army chief."
The crisis in the Central African Republic began late Friday after soldiers loyal to sacked chief of army staff Francois Bozize exchanged gunfire with presidential guard units and government troops.
"Shooting was heard in northern Bangui and near the airport in a neighborhood inhabited by officials in President Ange Felix Patasse's government, an AFP correspondent said."
"This was a common scene, as savers could avoid long lines this way."
"""You can't live with this level of hysteria,"" said Jorge, a 67-year old retiree who in all his years cannot recall a comparable situation."
"In addition, exporters have started settling their pending transactions."
"After a week-long currency holiday and to the surprise of many, the dollar hit only 2.4 pesos and closed at 2.1, with no need for intervention by the Central Bank."
"After deciding that it would take in all of the dollars in the banks' possession, the Central Bank decided late Friday to suspend the order."
"""Exporters held out until they saw that the dollar would not top 2.4."
"Three persons who were standing near him immediately asked him, almost in unison, at what price he was willing to sell."
The stock market had anticipated a dollar exchange rate that did not come about.
"""What do you want them to do when no one believes in the peso anymore,"" came the reply."
"Yesterday, however, the Merval closed down sharply at 410.84, in keeping with the trend over the past two days."
Last Wednesday the Merval index posted a sharp 5.94 percent rise when the stock exchange reopened.
"Thus, some mid-sized private banks moved into the retail foreign currency market."
"In the view of Leopoldo Oilvari Sivori of Bacque Sociedad de Bolsa, ""the behavior of the stock market is linked to the exchange rate."
"On the wholesale market, however, the dollar closed at 2 bid and 2.03 asked."
"According to analysts, the trend in the stock market is closely linked to the price of the dollar."
"At that point they started selling, and the exchange rate fell back to 1.75,"" one trader said."
"But when the greenback failed to achieve its expected value, investors who bought shares at a specific price started selling to earn some spread before the dollar could go lower."
The Merval index moved as expected at the start of a week in which the dollar did not change much in spite of the major uncertainty caused by the return of the single foreign exchange market after 11 years when one peso equaled one dollar.
Last Friday the Merval index closed down a marginal 0.32 percent after a session that traders had predicted would be calm.
"According to traders, ""in this way the market got liquidity and pushed prices lower."""
"Therefore, investors began selling their shares, which prompted a sharp drop in the Merval index."
Shares fell as prices corrected vis-a-vis the exchange rate of the dollar.
Also pushing the dollar down were the restrictions that still exist on the foreign exchange market and the scant trading liquidity.
"For five pesos he would stand in line while his ""customer"" had a soft drink or took care of other business."
"Although theoretically this threatened to increase the amount of money in circulation, it did not because of the shortage of pesos at many automatic tellers around the city."
"Last week it rose because we had different expectations about the value of the dollar, but today it is correcting the 20 or 30 cents that the dollar is down."""
"Some specialists feel that ""anything could happen"" this week, but the trend is downward."
"Not all banks refrained from selling greenbacks, though."
Trends
At that point investors were anticipating a possible jump in the dollar when the currency market reopened.
"As if they were strolling through a shopping center, savers peered into exchange office windows, looking for the best price."
"""The calm was due to the fact that there were no importers around, because they do not have authorization,"" said Jorge Fogwill of Scotiabank Quilmes."
The presence of the crowd prompted occasional passers-by to express animated opinions and engage in almost philosophical debates about conditions in the country.
The Central Bank has not yet explained what transfers can be made or what the authorization rules will be for these transactions.
Weak Dollar Sends Merval Index Down 10.68 Percent
Atmosphere Heats up in Financial District Exchange Offices
"Until it does so, the wholesale market, which is the one that can stand up to the Central Bank, is going to remain closed,"" explained one trader at a front-line bank."
Investors saw equities as a way of hedging against a possible rise in the dollar.
"Thousands of people turned the corner of Sarmiento and San Martin, where most of the agencies are concentrated, into a pedestrian mall."
"Miguel, an unemployed man from Entre Rios, offered another way to avoid the wait."
Some specialists felt that the peso's appreciation against the dollar triggered a wave of selling on the stock market as the share prices set in accordance with a higher exchange rate than the one now drooped.
"""To sell dollars I have to stand in this line for two hours or so,"" shouted Alberto, a laboratory executive."
"""Buying dollars for more than 2 pesos is not a good deal,"" said Alfredo Piano, the head of the company that bears his name."
"""There are still no regulations."
"As was to be expected, people did not want to support prices beyond 2.15 pesos to the dollar."""
Only after walking up and down several blocks and comparing the quotes did people get in line and endure the midday heat to buy or sell the coveted greenback.
In an operation that morning they arrested 12 illegal currency traders near Corrientes and San Martin.
"""Great, keep on buying dollars so there'll be more and more poor people in the country,"" shouted one."
He went on to say that the investors who bought shares in recent months start selling as quickly as possible when they see that the dollar exchange rate is not what they expected.
"Traders are expecting as calm a session today as yesterday, at least until the Central Bank decides to spell out which transfers it will authorize in the future."
"Unauthorized street traders flourished, expecting to make a killing."
"In a session that traders described as ""wait and see,"" trading volume hit 32.6 million pesos."
The people in these lines were in a foul mood.
"The board showed 25 stocks lower, 11 higher, and 5 unchanged."
The government got through the first day of transactions on the floating foreign exchange market without too many difficulties.
"""If there are no importers, the market has no reason to heat up, and as long as this continues, there will be no need for the Central Bank to intervene,"" he added."
The Buenos Aires Stock Exchange's Merval index fell 10.68 percent on the first day of the single foreign exchange market.
But the Federal Police cleared the area.
"Among the biggest losers were Acindar (down 14.88 percent), Banco Frances (down 13.68 percent), Perez Companc (down 11.31 percent), and Telecom Argentina (down 10.96 percent)."
"The exchange rate on the retail market, which started at between 2.3 and 2.4 pesos, fell sharply in the early afternoon hours after some exporters began settling their positions."
Yesterday was also the first day that holders of salary direct-deposit accounts were able to access all their money.
"Among the strongest gainers were Gas Natural Ban (up 12.7 percent), Banco Bansud (up 7.69 percent), Instituto Rosembusch (up 4 percent), and Sociedad Comercial del Plata (up 2.7 percent)."
"Hence, when investors saw that the dollar was trading at between 1.9 and 2.3 pesos, they began selling off their shares to make as much profit as they could."
"They also explained that the stock market's behavior would be hard to predict in the coming days since it will depend mainly on the greenback; as a result, many are saying that there will be ""upward and downward price swings."""
"Meanwhile, economist Miguel Bein, a former secretary of economic policy, said that ""the overshooting already happened when the dollar went from 1 to 2 pesos."
The boards at exchange offices were again the focus of greatest attention in the Buenos Aires financial district.
"""I'm not sure whether I should wait in line or sell to one of the street traders, because they'll even give me a few cents more,"" said Fabian, a 36-year old attorney."
"As if the crowd and people's nerves were already not enough to heat up the atmosphere, at noon a march by the Argentine Production Movement and the demonstrations against banks wound up scaring away several savers, who decided to conduct their transactions another day."
"The police presence did not stop them from seeking out savers, however."
The average prices at exchange offices had the dollar closing yesterday at 1.85 bid and 2.15 asked.
"The European initiative will serve as a test of not only Israel's intentions toward the peace process that are known for being negative, but also as a test of the US stand."
"The European Union, which is historically and geographically more closer to the Middle East than the United States, had to make a move after the Europeans ran out of patience toward the worsening US stand that supports the Israeli right-wing policies."
"Under this plan, the negotiations should focus on a mechanism for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories, ending the settlement activity, finding a just solution to the issue of Palestinian refugees, and allowing time to reorganize the Palestinian house from within with a view to achieving democracy and introducing a multi-party system."
The European plan is sensible because it calls for setting up a Palestinian state in the territories that were seized in 1967 in line with the international resolutions provided that the Israeli side officially agrees to this move.
"Perhaps the most important characteristic of the new European initiative is the fact that it annuls the hardline Israeli-US stand, which rejects any kind of political negotiations unless the violence stops completely."
There is no doubt whatsoever that the Palestinian people welcome and support the new European initiative because it is bold and fair and seeks to revive the peace process on realistic and just bases.
"The United States pressured the weaker side, the Palestinians, who are under occupation and subjected to repressive Israeli measures, including assassinations, arrests, incursions into cities, demolition of hundreds of homes, and uprooting of thousands of trees."
"Spain and France, which were at the forefront, led an intensive media drive to highlight what is actually happening in the Palestinian territories and extricate the peace process from the stalemate."
The peace process was deadlocked as a result of the oppressive Israeli military campaign against the Palestinian nationalistic move and Israel's insistence on suspending the political negotiations and focusing on military actions to subjugate the Palestinian people and liquidate their legitimate rights and aspirations.
"The United States, which is pleased with Israel, did not see these Israeli practices and instead focused its attention on the Palestinians' reactions that were generated by the Israeli provocations."
"This initiative will show whether the United States will give up its complete and blind bias toward Israel in order to achieve a just solution restoring the Palestinian people's legitimate rights and guaranteeing peace, security, and stability for all nations in the region."
The Palestinian leadership and President Yasir Arafat welcomed this plan a few weeks ago.
This initiative is not partial.
The Europeans were in the right when they emphasized that this unrealistic stand brought the peace process to a deadlock and plunged the Palestinians and Israelis into an endless cycle of violence.
"It does not turn a blind eye to the Israeli practices, occupation, and settlement activity and dismisses the notion of punishing the wronged Palestinian people who have been deprived of all their national and human rights."
"Meanwhile, a European initiative, launched by all the European Union members, gradually began to take shape."
"This initiative disapproves of the flimsy pretexts to increase the Palestinians' suffering and encourage the Israeli right-wing stands, which is what the US Administration has been doing lately."
"Therefore, the political negotiations should be resumed ahead of any effort aimed at achieving a peace acceptable to both sides."
"Washington, February 11 (XINHUA) -- US Senate Majority leader Tom Daschle criticized on Monday President George W. Bush for his remarks that described Iran, Iraq and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) as ""axis of evil""."
"In an interview on PBS' ""The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,"" Daschle said Bush's remarks were wrong."
"""I think we've got to be very careful with the rhetoric of that kind,"" he said."
"Daschle's criticism was the first from a leading Democrat since Bush delivered his State of the Union address to Congress in which he used the word of ""axis of evil"" to label Iran, Iraq and the DPRK."
"Bush's description of Iran, Iraq and DPRK as ""axis of evil"" has courted strong criticism from the three countries as well as some of its allies."
"But Daschle also saw the three countries as threats to the United States, saying that Bush was ""right in calling attention to the danger they pose to the United States."""
"""I think that it's important for us to look at each of these countries as threats to this country clearly, as problems that we' ve got to address clearly"", he said."
"The diamond merchant was married to Hazel Crane, a close friend of Madikizela-Mandela."
"The Johannesburg Magistrate's Court ruled on Tuesday Saad would stand trial from August 12 to 30 for the murder of diamond merchant Shai Avissar, who disappeared in 1999."
Saad will remain in custody until the trial.
"Avissar's body was found in a shallow grave on a smallholding near Pretoria on October 17, 1999."
JOHANNESBURG Feb 12 Sapa ALLEGED ISRAELI MAFIA MEMBER TO STAND TRIAL IN AUGUST
Alleged Israeli mafia member Lior Saad will stand trial in August for the murder of the estranged husband of a close friend of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.
The delegation is led by AmCham Singapore president Landis W. Hicks.
"Meanwhile, Rini said after a meeting with the AmCham delegation that almost all of the delegation members had praised the current security situation in the country."
Some local radical groups threatened to attack U.S. interests and citizens in Indonesia following the U.S. government's move to strike at Afghanistan several months ago.
"US Ambassador to Indonesia Ralph L. Boyce praised the Indonesian government on Monday [18 Mar] for its efforts to protect foreign investors in the country, including Americans, but warned that investors were still concerned about the security of their investments."
"Boyce, along with 12 members of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Singapore, earlier met with President Megawati Soekarnoputri and Minister of Trade and Industry Rini M. Soewandi."
But the government was quick to give assurances about the safety of foreign workers in Indonesia.
"But, he said, ""Investors will come to Indonesia not based on fears, somehow, that they would be physically threatened, but rather in the hope that the capital invested in Indonesia would be secure and that means transparency, rule of law, protection legally, etc.,"" Boyce told a press conference."
"We welcome it."""
"""We take seriously the government's responsibility to protect Americans -- not only Americans but also other foreigners in Indonesia."
"""The Singapore-based members of this mission want to hear from senior members of the Indonesian government about efforts to expand foreign business participation in the economy."
"We know that Indonesia is a country of enormous potential and believe that now is the time to build our future together,"" Hicks said in a statement."
"The delegates include Tan Hup Thye from Refco Singapore Pte Ltd., Stuart Dean of GE International, and Edward Gilbert of Merrill Lynch (Asia Pacific) Ltd."
"Boyce acknowledged that the Indonesian government had taken serious steps to ensure the personal safety of American investors and other foreigners, who appeared at risk several months ago during the political tension following the US-led war against Afghanistan's Taliban regime."
"Rini said she had pointed to the Batam and Bintan islands as secure places for doing business, citing the small number of labour disputes in both islands."
The AmCham delegation is in Indonesia for a two-day visit to assess business opportunities in this country.
Some U.S. companies temporarily closed their offices here following the threats.
"However, since this is a new concept, there may be room for negotiation."""
"These are geostrategic plans at moments when time is exerting pressure, and also pressing the speed at which the world turns."
"Eduardo Duhalde's agenda, during his first departure from the country since he assumed the presidency, calls for a key meeting on Friday with the IMF's managing director, Horst Koehler, (which he will attend accompanied by Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov), and two occasions on which he will have the floor, addressing the world (for five minutes on one, and three minutes on the other) concerning the topic under discussion; the Monterrey Consensus: or greater assistance from the developed countries to those that are underdeveloped, which in fact will be approved by consensus."
"""Well, one never knows,"" slipped in the source, becoming lost on an escalator."
"And, while striding hastily through the large facilities of the International Business Center (Cintermex), he sketched an explanation: ""Argentina is the leading case of an era in which everyone pays dearly for his mistakes, and somehow manages as best he can."
How?
"As soon as he arrives on Wednesday, Duhalde will meet with Fox, perhaps spearheading the explanation of the Argentine situation to Bush: a possibility that is not entirely clear among the Mexican officials, especially since, in principle, the virtual plan will have to take place step by step."
"""Certainly not,"" was the comment made in a private dialogue with La Nacion by a diplomatic source from the United States who, with a legion of colleagues, is attending the United Nations Conference on Financing for Development that opened yesterday in Monterrey, Mexico."
"Apparently not in Monterrey, where Bush will have a full agenda, and without contacts with other chief executives, except for Mexico's President Vicente Fox, and Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien, since they are trading partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)."
The same thing is happening to the countries now.
"""First I listen, and then I will see,"" commented one of them to La Nacion."
Then what?
"According to some sources, the crisis is in a bind: the IMF is asking for more belt-tightening, and the government is asking for more money."
More Political Than Economic
"Despite this, it gives a clue to the gap that existed, and still exists, between the reality and the statistics of the international credit agencies."
"A source from the United Nations observed ironically: ""If Chile were Iraq, and if President Ricardo Lagos were Saddam Hussein, Argentina would have Bush's full support."" Chile is not Iraq, nor is Lagos Saddam, fortunately, of course."
"The source commented: ""Argentine is in a position to be an alternative reference point for the United States, to the detriment of Brazil which, in view of the internal and external vicissitudes facing Fernando Henrique Cardoso, is, day by day, becoming somewhat weak."""
"Ergo: without belt-tightening there is no money, and without money there is no belt-tightening."
"If someone earns 1,000 and spends 1,500, he will inevitably succumb to bankruptcy."
"With a strategy that would permit Duhalde, if he does not receive a clear signal from the IMF, not to call for elections in 90 days, for example, and to become a lame duck, waiting for his successor, he explained."
"It is common knowledge, among most of the small groups, that the Argentine crisis is more political than economic, and that, as one Latin American diplomat accredited to the UN remarked, the formula in question does not hold much mystery: ""A rapprochement with the United States is indispensable, because it is the only one that can extricate them from this."""
The UN International Conference on Financing for Development opened in Monterrey on 18 March (Telam photo)
"With 58 chief executives immersed in signing a document which, as La Nacion was told by the Argentine ambassador to the United Nations, Arnoldo Listre, gives a clue to the direction in which we are heading: ""It shows a new organization in which the market economy is accepted as a fundamental factor for development and, unlike the cold war, is rid of the North-South confrontation."""
It was learned that Foreign Minister Carlos Ruckauf and Foreign Secretary Jorge Castaneda may already have talked about this.
"UN Secretary General Kofi Annan himself said, in his time, that the situation of indebted, undeveloped countries must be consideed, so as to avoid the repetition of a crisis such as ours."
"Monterrey, Mexico--Choked, hushed voices, some of them astounded, are not guessing correctly about the dilemma of the chicken or the egg into which the Argentine crisis has become converted, almost grotesquely: will the International Monetary Fund (IMF) endorse concrete aid to the country, apart from the presumable good intentions of its board members and technicians, without the approval of George W. Bush?"
"In that document, the Monterrey Consensus, free trade, the amendment on the distortion with agricultural subsidies, and the treatment of the external debt as fundamental pivotal points, benefit Argentina."
"In the documents, Argentina ranks in 59th place for its per capita income: $7,440, according to the World Bank's report on development: a substantially devalued figure after the default and the end of the currency board arrangement."
Very well.
"The entire world -- not the Palestinians alone -- is waiting to hear an official Israeli statement regarding its recognition of the Palestinian national rights and its readiness to withdraw from all lands occupied in 1967, put an end to the settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza, and support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state de facto."
"Some Israeli officials, particularly Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer, have stated that the success or failure of US envoy Zinni's mission hinges on the Palestinians only because they might carry out a suicide or shooting attack that will make Israel retaliate, thus bringing the region back to the cycle of violence."
Such a statement will actually constitute the beginning of a real era of peace and the end of the era of violence and counterviolence.
"Such an Israeli statement would not only serve Zinni's mission but would also accelerate the attainment of a permanent arrangement in which Israel would gain peace and security in exchange for its withdrawal from the Palestinian lands, the end of its colonialist occupation, and the renunciation of its mentality of domination and expansion, which have caused calamities and catastrophes in the past five decades."
"Clearly, the Palestinian side has acceded to all demands -- even more than that -- when it recognized Israel's right to exist on 78 percent of historical Palestine."
"The coming days and weeks will show whether Israel is actually ready to positively and objectively deal with the Palestinian national rights without trying to maneuver, place obstacles, or set impossible conditions during Zinni's mission."
"In any case, Zinni's mission is to make sure that certain measures are adopted as soon as possible to pave the road to a political settlement of the Palestinian question."
"Consequently, Zinni will find it difficult to attain a cease-fire and commence the implementation of the Tenet understandings and Mitchell recommendations."
"This allegation contradicts the simplest fact on the ground, as Israel is the one that occupies most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and Israel is the one that possesses vast military power which it uses to make incursions into and raid Palestinian cities and refugee camps; to intimidate women and children; to assassinate innocent activists and citizens; to destroy buildings, facilities, infrastructure, roads, water pipes, and electricity and telephone poles; to attack Palestinian ambulances and kill medical teams; and to carry out other retaliatory, suppressive, and devastating practices."
It cannot make more concessions.
Israel's compliance with the required commitments will be the real test not only of its readiness to facilitate the US envoy's mission but also its readiness to establish a just peace which is in the interest of all parties concerned.
"Thus roles were distributed specifically and clearly, and each role was drawn accurately and with care, exactly as was the case in the great movie ""The Second Wife"" between the tyrannical mayor with power, Abu-al-Ila, the simple peasant who owns nothing but the clothes on his back and a gang of children, and his wife, who was coveted by the mayor."
"Therefore, the United States endeavors hard to save Israel from the serious crisis that Sharon has put himself into."
"Then you find a dramatic portrayal of the reversed situation in which the Shaykh, or in this case the ""US,"" Anthony Zinni, advises Abu-al-Ila, ""Palestinian,"" to bow and accept the mayor's, ""Israel's,"" demands, or else he would be convicted of possessing weapons of destruction in the eyes of the authorities."
"Thus, after the US mass media and newspapers revealed the report by the Pentagon that listed seven countries to be attacked with US atomic weapons in case US national security was threatened, it became clear that the United States develops and produces weapons of mass destruction to threaten the stability and security of the world, and that it violates the United Nations Charter attacking independent and sovereign nations."
"Immediately a neutral intermediate appears, represented in the fake imposter Shaykh, who is the friend of the mayor in the axis of evil."
"Namely that the countries of the axis of evil, from his point of view, are those that produce, develop, and amass weapons of mass destruction in a way that threatens the security and stability of its neighbors, as well as all the countries in the world."
"We can review, for example, the voting results in the Security Council to see how Washington always defends Israel, then how Britain always justifies the stances by both countries in admirable harmony."
"The countries of the US axis are similar, for they cooperate, are joined by a strategic bond, and each defends the other and supports it with words and deeds."
"Of course the second side in the US axis is Israel, and definitely the third side will go to no one but Britain, as it conforms to the same criteria and because it completely supports the US stance and considers it the absolute right in all cases."
"So now we only wait for the advice of Haj Zinni to obey those in authority, so that we would not become terrorists like Iraq, North Korea, and Iran!"
"It has now become our right to announce clearly that the United States had become one of the sides of the axis of evil according to the same criteria set by the United States itself, and declared by its President George Bush."
"If US moves go beyond China's limits of tolerance, it will seriously affect Sino-US diplomatic relations."
This does not mean that China and the United States have achieved any progress on the Taiwan issue.
The two cases contrast sharply.
"""Bush cannot conduct himself in an upright manner and he speaks insincerely!"""
"Yu Keli, deputy director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences [CASS], said that since taking office, the Bush administration has gone farther and farther in ""interfering in China's internal affairs and meddling in the Taiwan issue"" and has entirely run counter to the aspirations of the two peoples for the healthy development of Sino-US relations."
On public occasions Bush seems to show consideration for the US anti-China forces and pro-Taiwan faction and to even appease Taiwan separatists.
Now the United States sees her former friend as an enemy and her former enemy as a friend.
"Li Jiaquan, research fellow at the CASS Institute of Taiwan Studies, said: During his visit to China, Bush steered clear of the Sino-US three joint communiques and one China on two important occasions, his joint conference with Jiang Zemin and his speech at Qinghua University."
"Japan's militarism used to be the US enemy, while China used to be a friend of the United States."
"However, in his meetings with Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji, Bush stressed one China and the Sino-US three communiques."
"Li Jiaquan felt that it is very appropriate to quote a line from Guo Moruo, ""confounding right and wrong, being kind to the enemy and hard on friends,"" to describe the United States."
"Compared with the Clinton administration, the Bush administration evidently is in retrogression on the Taiwan issue."
"Sun Yan, assistant professor at the International Relations College of the Beijing University, also held that on the issue of international anti-terror cooperation, the United States wanted to rope in China in order to remove obstacles to its next phase of attack against Iraq."
"Beijing, 19 Mar (Wen Wei Po)--In response to the US decision to allow Tang Yao-ming to visit the United States, experts on Taiwan affairs said here in interviews with this reporter that this showed a lack of sincerity by the United States in improving Sino-US relations."
"Most international observer groups have condemned the conduct of the poll, as have many Western governments, notably Britain and the United States."
"""It is a bad report that can only lead to bad decisions,"" Moyo said, denouncing the report as ""opinionated"" and ""one-sided"" and saying it ""lacks credibility and cannot withstand any objective scrutiny."""
Critics of the land reforms say the measures have also aggravated a food shortage in Zimbabwe that threatens to worsen because of drought.
"The report concluded the poll had been marred by violence, intimidation and suspect electoral practices designed to benefit Mugabe, a conclusion also reached by the Zimbabwean opposition and much of the West."
"The suspension validates ""our own refusal to accept the result as legitimate,"" said Welshman Ncube, secretary general for Tsvangirai's opposition Movement for Democratic Change."
"""To some extent we have the sense that this is a halfway house,"" he said."
"LONDON, March 19 (AFP) - The Commonwealth suspended Zimbabwe for one year on Tuesday, taking action against the regime of President Robert Mugabe a week after controversial elections returned him to power."
"Foreign Secretary Jack Straw also praised the decision, saying that ""the message could not be clearer."""
"Tsvangirai had earlier suggested that ""Mbeki and Obasanjo are not going to allow that (suspension), they are going to present a position that the Zimbabweans are talking, so there may be a deferment of any action."""
"A spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said: ""He clearly welcomes the decision by the Commonwealth troika and believes that it is absolutely the right thing to do."""
"The latest killing of a white farmer, Terry Ford, came just a day after Mugabe's inauguration."
"""The committee decided to suspend Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth for one year with immediate effect,"" Australian Prime Minister John Howard told reporters here."
"""The presidential elections are over,"" the information minister said."
"Tsvangirai, who had been tipped to win a free and fair election, has said he would negotiate with a view to running a fresh election and ""restoring legitimacy"" but on Tuesday he ruled out any ""meaningful discussions"" unless Mugabe's government cracked down on violence."
"Washington is still mulling a response to the election and ""continuing its conversations with allied nations about what the proper response should be to the fraudulent election in Zimbabwe,"" said Ari Fleischer, spokesman for US President George W. Bush."
"Although Mbeki has not specifically given his own views, an official South African observer team said the election result should be respected."
"""They were held in terms of our laws and our constitution, and the next election is not for six years."""
"But at a summit in Australia earlier this month ahead of the election, Commonwealth leaders postponed action against Harare over its defiant stance on the presence of certain international observers to monitor the voting."
"The suspension came just after Switzerland said it was slapping sanctions on the southern African country, including a freeze on financial assets which might be held by government officials in Swiss banks."
"Goff said that while he welcomed the suspension, it appeared it had been done reluctantly."
"Zimbabwe's Information Minister Jonathan Moyo immediately blasted the decision to lump his nation in with Pakistan, which is also currently suspended from the Commonwealth."
The land reforms have been marred by political violence led by liberation war veterans who support Mugabe.
"The panel had been expected to defer or reject calls for Zimbabwe's suspension after Mbeki and Obasanjo held talks Monday with Mugabe and defeated opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, and apparently proposed to mediate in talks between the two sides."
"""This issue will be revisited in 12 months' time,"" he said."
Mugabe was declared the winner of the presidential vote with 56 percent of votes to Tsvangirai's 42 percent.
"In his inauguration speech on Sunday, Mugabe promised to accelerate his controversial land reforms begun in July 2000, which aim to resettle blacks on white-owned farms in a bid to reverse colonial-era injustices."
"The surprise decision comes after the 54-nation group failed to reach agreement on sanctions against Harare before the voting, when African leaders rallied around the anti-colonialist Mugabe, who has held power since independence from Britain in 1980."
New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff welcomed the Commonwealth's suspension of Zimbabwe but said New Zealand was likely to impose sanctions anyway.
"The decision, taken by a three-way panel of Howard and presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, follows a damning report on the March 9-11 vote by Commonwealth observers."
"""At one station were not allowed in and told that we had nothing to do with the Zimbabwe issue."
The United Democratic Movement was still undecided.
"The booklet was published by the Electoral Institute of South Africa, in Pretoria."
"Malinga, who represented South African churches on 50-member mission, told journalists during breakfast at the Diakonia Council of Churches in Durban, that she was uncomfortable with the manner in which the team had been treated -- even before they left South Africa."
"They were turned away in twenties, thirties and fifties."""
"""We were also advised to be vigilant in what we say in private and in public,"" Malinga said."
"The Inkatha Freedom Party, Democratic Alliance, New National Party, African Christian Democratic Party, the Pan Africanist Congress and the United Christian Democratic Party had disagreed with the ANC conclusion."
"Malinga, who was based in southern Matabeleland near Beitbridge, said the election were characterised by -- among others -- intimidation."
"Even local observers could not enter these stations,"" she said."
At another station we were ordered to stay at least 100 metres away.
"""Personally I felt that one is going to be used here, but I nevertheless hoped the presence of outsiders in Zimbabwe would stop some illegal acts which may have been committed."""
"In a preliminary, Motsuenyane declared the Zimbabwe poll ""legitimate"", adding they could, however, not be openly described as free and fair."
"""Even in the queues at polling centres there was a lot of fear and tension."
The election was run by the police and the army who carried weapons.
"SAOM on Monday stopped short of declaring the Zimbabwean presidential election free and fair, but the African National Congress majority on the committee declared the poll ""credible""."
"The majority report, endorsed only by the ANC, said the observer mission had noted that over three million Zimbabweans had cast their votes and this substantially represented the will of the people."
"Bam on Sunday said she believed Zimbabwe's election was not free and fair, adding they were not in line with international standards as well as those of her organisation."
Each member was handed a booklet containing guidelines on Zimbabwean election laws.
"The United States, Britain, local Zimbabwean observers, and the Commonwealth observer team also described the poll as not free and fair."
"Under these circumstances nobody can feel free."""
Other delegates in SAOM aligned themselves with the findings of the Southern African Development Community parliamentary forum that said the vote had not met SADC's norms and standards.
"Malinga said according to the guidelines in the booklet, the election had been legitimate."
She said international observers were treated with suspicion by the police.
"""Many people were also unable to vote because their names were not on the voters' role."
Another member of the South African Observer Mission to Zimbabwe says the past weekend's presidential election in the southern African country was not free and fair
Methodist Bishop Purity Malinga on Tuesday echoed the sentiments of South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) chairwoman Brigalia Bam that Zimbabwe election did not conform to international standards.
"She believed that SAOM head, Dr Sam Motsuenyane had probably based his findings on the guidelines."
DURBAN March 19 Sapa SA OBSERVER: ZIM ELECTIONS NOT FREE AND FAIR
"The Nigerian leader, President Olusegun Obasanjo, had urged the minister not to attack Blair frontally over Britain's negative position regarding Zimbabwe, but to deal with the presidential election preparations in a dispassionate and precise manner."
"Meanwhile, back in Harare, some strange things were happening with the Commonwealth mission."
Meikles Hotel has long been known as a hot bed of opposition politics.
The hand symbolised reconciliation; and Blair accepted it.
"On the spurious grounds that the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) election campaign centre was in an adjoining building, the Commonwealth observers moved out to the privately owned Meikles Hotel."
"Instead, an Australian member of the Federal Parliament, Julie Bishop, vented her anger towards the President and Government, and the electoral process, in Australia's media."
"During the 2000 parliamentary elections, 80 rooms at Meikles Hotel were booked by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)."
C'wealth mission conduct questionable
"The final straw that confirmed that Australia had abandoned any pretence of fairness to all sides in the dispute came when the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, ordered his High Commissioner in Harare not to attend Sunday's inauguration of Robert Mugabe as President of Zimbabwe."
"These are some of the realities that Presidents Obasanjo of Nigeria and Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, confronted as they flew from Harare last night for their meeting in London tomorrow with the Australian leader who is the third member of the Commonwealth troika."
There was also the curious appointment of and behaviour by individual members of the Commonwealth mission who should have been sworn to secrecy as part of their mission and who should have expressed their views only through the chair of the mission.
"The British leader fudged his reply and the Commonwealth leaders were left with the distinct impression that the ""Blair report"" had already been written in London before the Commonwealth mission even left for Zimbabwe."
"There, unlike the Sheraton where the national newspaper The Herald is distributed to guests, the pro-opposition Daily News is given freely to guests."
Their mission was simply to rubber stamp the adverse report that Britain had already written.
"And close by, Howard will have the British government and the western media."
"But there was still an unanswered question in the minds of the Commonwealth leaders: How had the British Prime Minister seen the purported ""Commonwealth report on Zimbabwe"" when they had not?"
They had been pre-booked by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign Affairs into the partly Government-owned Sheraton Hotel.
"Presidents Obasanjo and Mbeki, however, have the benefit of their own observer missions to Zimbabwe as well as the support of the vast majority of the Commonwealth."
"The Australians, in common with other white members of the Commonwealth, the European Union (EU), the Americans, Norwegians and the Swiss stayed away from that event saying they do not recognise the election and therefore Mugabe as the head of State."
"Furthermore, as anyone who has been following the Zimbabwean Press can testify, many of the Meikles farms around the country have been acquired by the State as part of the land reform programme."
"But because of their openly hostile position towards the President and Government, the BBC was refused accreditation to cover the presidential election."
"The Commonwealth Secretary-General, Don McKinnon of New Zealand is also known to support his country's decision to condemn Zimbabwe's presidential election."
"Blair's second faux pas in Australia, according to some of the assembled Commonwealth leaders, came in his response to a remarkably conciliatory speech by Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister, Dr Stan Mudenge."
The Zimbabwean minister did this.
Why were several former and recent employees of the Commonwealth Secretariat accredited as observers?
"Although the Commonwealth missions nominally operate on the basis of ""consensus"", she and others of a similar view were dismissed as ""troublemakers"" by one of the former Secretariat staff-cum-observer."
"By A Special Correspondent - Britain's Prime Minister, Tony Blair, privately did two things concerning Zimbabwe during the recent ""retreat"" by Commonwealth leaders in Australia that raise questions about today's meeting in London by the troika of Australia, Nigeria and South Africa."
"The Commonwealth leaders, many of them in the first place unable to understand the dispute between Zimbabwe and its former coloniser, Britain, breathed a collective sigh of relief at what they hoped was the beginning of the healing process."
No doubt Blair will fight on.
It is notable that the Commonwealth observer mission did not move again although the opposition had now joined them in the same hotel.
"Normally staff make up the Secretariat in support of a mission populated by more eminent, neutral persons."
Then Mudenge proposed that Britain and Zimbabwe bury past differences and work together in the future.
"And, in line with Commonwealth consensus, the views of the majority are taken to be the views of the Commonwealth as a whole."
The first was that Blair said he had received an interim report from the Commonwealth observer mission to Zimbabwe that condemned the outcome of the presidential election - before Zimbabweans had even had a chance to vote.
The composition of the Commonwealth mission raised further questions.
"Howard, however, will not be isolated at the three-member meeting at Marlborough House in London."
"But the solution to the present impasse lies with the people of Zimbabwe and Africa, not with the people of Britain and Europe."
"A Namibian woman member of the Commonwealth observer mission, who is the well-respected, Deputy Speaker of the National Council in her country, held different views to those stated in the interim Commonwealth report that was released only after the election results were known."
"But how could Blair have ""a Commonwealth report"" when no one else had received such a report that should be channeled through the Secretariat to all members, asked one of the other 53 Commonwealth leaders at the retreat?"
"Then Mudenge rose to his feet, strode over to Blair and thrust out his hand."
"While the Commonwealth observer mission and many of the foreign journalists were assembled in the hotel, the opposition leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Morgan Tsvangirai, moved in with them, taking a complete floor for himself and his entourage."
"""In principle, my personal opinion is that we shouldn't go against the current."
"The treaty also pledges that the launching of space objects be purely for humanitarian purposes and not for military purposes,"" Priyatna said."
The Convention also sets out various claims that can be made by states who have suffered damages as a result of other states' space projects.
"If a rocket launch fails, debris weighing hundreds of tonnes will be scattered over the densely-populated island of Java or the tourist island of Bali, and on to the east as far as Timor."
"The kangaroo country should implement risk management procedures before opening the space station on Christmas Island, and open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states, and open complete access to cooperation to all states without exception."
"Meaning that rather than challenging and issuing objections to the Australian space project, Indonesia should take advantage of our southern neighbour's space activities."
"""Australia is not allowed to prevent other states who want to cooperate on its space centre."
International law governing accountability if one nation's space debris falls on another is already in existence.
"As the nation most likely to suffer the impact of the Australian Space Port, Indonesia could rely on the simplest article in the Liability Convention, Section 14."
Indonesia at the very least needs to sign the UN Convention on Space as well as ratify several other treaties governing national activities in outer space.
"So far, the Indonesian Government has only ratified the 1972 Liability Convention."
"Although diplomatic overtures to express official objections have not yet been made, the government through the National Space and Flight Agency has already warned of the possible risks facing Indonesia."
"The problem is, this large-scale project right in our own backyard could not only potentially cause space debris consisting of bits of rocket, fuel and satellites to fall into Indonesian territory, but will also disrupt flights and shipping."
This convention only applies to space objects that fall into Indonesian sovereign territory.
This is a very important lesson for Indonesia.
These principles are upheld in the Space Treaty 1967.
"This is no different to arbitration hearings to resolve other cases,"" Priyatna said."
"In claiming compensation from the Soviet Union over Cosmos 954, Canada was forced to navigate numerous procedural complications."
"""If Australia then denies the claim, we need only demand that Australia produce proof that the space debris did not originate from its space centre activities."
"In the case of objections to the Christmas Island space station, Indonesia would need to be able to show that damage that has occurred within its territorial area was caused by space objects launched from the Christmas Island station."
It would suffice to submit a claim to the UN Claims Commission and state that the space debris in Indonesia had originated from the Australian space centre.
"Cosmos 1402 in January 1978 fell over the Northern Hemisphere and Cosmos 954, which contained radioactive substances, crashed above the uninhabited tundra of Canada in September 1977."
"This section allows states who have suffered damages to claim compensation through the International Claims Commission, which acts as the representative of the appellant state against the launching state (in this case Australia) or any other international organisation which can be classed as a launching state."
"The Convention basically sets out the responsibility of the launching state, either jointly or collectively, for the consequences of a launch failure from the time of launching through to the re-entry of a satellite to the Earth's atmosphere."
"Therefore, plans to construct a space port should be moved from Christmas Island if Australia is really willing to listen to Indonesia's objections."
"The nation should certainly be concerned about the plans to build a rocket launch pad, work on the infrastructure for which is due to start in 2002, with launches beginning from 2004."
"Of course, lodging a claim is not as simple as clapping one's hands."
"At such close proximity, if bilateral relations with Australia were to take a turn for the worse, firing at Indonesia would be extremely easy."
"On the other hand, Christmas Island is certainly an ideal location for rocket launches due to its proximity to the Equator and the geostationary orbit (GSO)."
"Rather we should the use the current to our mutual benefit,"" he said."
"Fortunately shrapnel from the former space station, which measured 33 x 30 x 27 metres and weighed 137 tonnes, burned up as it re-entered the earth's atmosphere somewhere over the Pacific Ocean between Chile and Australia."
"Australia's plans to construct a space port on Christmas Island, located just a stone's throw, a mere 500 kilometres south of Jakarta, has concerned some in the Indonesian Government."
It is sufficient at law to demonstrate the fact of the damage caused as a result of the space object identified as belonging to the launching state or a state that has participated in the space object launching.
"But the famous US space centre, the Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral in Florida is located relatively far from the Equator."
This principle means that the burden of proof that the claimant state has suffered damages does not lie on the state submitting its damages claim.
"Indonesia has only adopted one compensation principle, the Absolute Liability principle."
"The main convention is the UN Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, 28 March 1972, known as the 1972 Liability Convention."
"Australia should adhere to the Cardinal Principle of International Law, which states that all nations in the world must first respect and promote the humanitarian interests and progress of all humankind."
"Nevertheless, intact pieces of debris weighing up to 20 to 30 tonnes fell into the Pacific Ocean."
"A National Space and Flight Agency working paper suggest a high degree of difficulty if Indonesia, as a state that has suffered damage, were to lodge a damages claim."
The memory Russia's Mir space station which after 15 years fell to earth on 23 March 2001 is still fresh of.
"Prior to that, two Soviet satellites struck the earth."
Even more worrying is the possibility that a space station could be transformed into a military base and pose a threat to Indonesia's national sovereignty.
"Unlike other experts, Priyatna believes that Indonesia should not be too concerned [about the Australian planned space station]."
"""The Space Treaty 1967 obliges launching states to open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states in all its activities."
"Rather than issuing a letter of objection to the Australian Government, wouldn't it be better to join them in our own national interest?"" he asked."
"If a deadlock in negotiations occurs, the parties can ask the UN Claims Commission as a neutral party to act as adjudicator."
Indonesia can exploit this principle of the Space Treaty 1967.
This would of course require advanced technology and great cost to bring the matter to a claim submission.
"These UN Conventions are the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies 1967 (Space Treaty 1967), the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects 1972 (Liability Convention 1972), and finally, the Convention on Registration of Objections launched into Outer Space 1974 (Registration Convention 1974)."
"But the problem is, who can ensure that these guidelines will indeed be adhered to?"
"Notwithstanding the above, in reality only three of the 15 launch pad centres worldwide are located near the Equator - Kourou, San Marco and Sriharikota."
The basic principles of the Space Treaty 1967 oblige Australia as the launching state to open the possibility of humanitarian cooperation in the field of space endeavour.
"Unfortunately, historical precedent shows that claiming compensation is no easy matter."
"Indonesia would not need to produce further evidence to substantiate its claim, he said."
"But in conversation with Kompas on Sunday (17 Mar), one of Indonesia's few space law experts, Prof Dr Priyatna Abdurrasyid, expressed a different opinion."
"""We have discovered that there is a certain family around Lomahasha, which is suspected of assisting illegal immigrants with shelter and transport."
"According to the army spokesman, Corporal Nhlanhla Dlamini, the key areas where most of the immigrants were found was Lomahasha, Mhlumeni and Sitsatsaweni."
"These include a Nissan Skyline in Mafutseni, a Mercedes Benz, A Toyota and an Isuzu 2.5 diesel at Nkalashane."
The USDF also found four stolen cars in different places in the country.
"Last month, 53 cattle were also stolen around the country, of which 17 were spotted inside Mozambique driven by three men armed with rifles thought to be AK47s."
Last month members of the Umbutfo Swaziland Defence Force [USDF] found 594 illegal aliens in the country.
